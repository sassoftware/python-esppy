1596861,an amazing/delightful work!!,"i am now such a maureen dowd fan! this woman is by far one of the best authors i've ever had the pleasure to read. witty, astute, scathing in her assessment of the current non-elected president...not to mention his (or should i say his daddy's?) cronies, the guys who are really calling the shots in washington, dowd has completely captured the essence of ineptitude displayed daily (hour-by-hour? every other minute?) by the man who would-be-but-isn't-really our president.most interesting, i think, is the fact that her writings began well before the mis-election of 2000...providing the reader with a funny/frightening opportunity for hindsight. gosh, if w's mis-guided supporters had only been paying attention earlier, maybe none of us would be in this ""mess"" right now! sigh...not only am i recommending ""bushworld"" to my friends, i am personally sending copies to anyone and everyone i know...merry (early) christmas! don't forget to vote... : )",5,1

8432421,"Classic, contemporary romance","What do you call a musician without a girlfriend? A: Homeless. That old joke gets a new twist when the struggling musician is a woman who can't pay the rent and gets tossed into the street by her roommates. Another twist is the novel idea of a handsome young man who has the fortitude and willpower to wait for the wedding night.It doesn't take long for the usual tropes of the romance genre to come into play. Without delivering spoilers, I can only say that the plot has more holes than a golf course, but the narrative is so engaging, most readers won't mind.In spite of my barely willing suspension of disbelief, I kept turning pages (and skimming some too) becauseI actually cared to see how the story played out. And that's a tribute to the author, to be able to tell a predictable story in a way that keeps readers engaged.",4,1

If you love good music, get this album.",5,1

Like &quot;Three's Company&quot;, &quot;the best of&quot; just doesn't get it. Especially when I know as soon as I buy it they'll come out with the whole season.

The book was written like a movie, and perhaps that is why it was so engrossing. It just cut right to the chase and the action, and it never really died down.Good character development - loved Eph Goodweather and his struggles as a caring father/dedicated doctor, and Satrakian was a little trite but still interesting. Nora wasn't really developed at all... but the cover does say ""Book One"", so there is still time for that!I knew going in that these were not going to be sexy and alluring vampires - but yikes, they were gross! More like zombies than vamps.Cliffhanger at the end, but hey, I knew that was coming!  :)",4,1

506698,One of Lewis' Best,"The Screwtape Letters is a short work of religious fiction by C.S. Lewis originally published in 1942.  Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with well-known works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.The Screw Tape Letters consists of a series of letters between a senior demon and his apprentice regarding how to best tempt his human ""patient"".  This setting is used by Lewis to discuss many of the hurdles and sins that humans encounter in day-to-day life.  Lewis has the rare skill of being able to effectively communicate theological ideas in an unassuming manner to the general reader.  From my perspective this is one of Lewis' best pieces of religious fiction (the other being the Great Divorce).  Many of the challenges and failings mentioned in the book continue to resonate with the modern reader.Overall, I highly recommended this short book to all readers.  Those who enjoy this small book may also enjoy The Great Divorce.",4,1

Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby is a far less likable character in the book, and Troy similarly &#8211; with a chip on his shoulder. However, I like her writing &#8211; it's colourful and original.An old lady sees something unsavoury and shocking (a copulating couple that she recognises) during a walk in the woods &#8211; later that day she is murdered. In true &#34;Midsomer&#34; style there follow 2 more murders, apparently unrelated but of course after many wild goose chases and red herrings, Barnaby with assistance from Troy ties them all up and resolves the case(s).

There are other books similar to this, but when I reviewed them, it almost seemed the exactly the same as the this book (same verbage, pictures, examples??? wassup with that?)

Bixby, I met in 1977-78 after the first 1/2 season of the Hulk, I was only 14-16 years old. He was heading up to Yellowstone Park with his son. He was a great actor, and director, I can seriously say he would never be typecasts from the show. He was very talented, directing episodes of Blossom, Goodnight Beantown, The Woman who loved Elvis and episodes of Mr. Merlin.Ferrigno I met when he was a guest poser in the Mr. Wyoming contest. He was on the comeback trail after being retired from competitive bodybuilding for some 17 years. He weighted in at 310 pounds and looked great for being in his 40s.The Hulk series will always be my favorite, there was never a show like it before on television, or since.",5,1

Per the spec noted for this unit on amazon,  the unit has airplay function.  Meaning I can hook up my devices wireless to listen to music I pick (e.g. Pandora, my own music on Iphone or Ipad, etc).  No!! You have to buy another device (a repeater) which may cost up to $100. And Yamaha carefully did not clearly explain this.  I have contacted Yamaha and complained, more than once.

Those to whom I showed these glasses offered suggestions of using the glasses for brandy or even some wine sampling.With their exquisite shape the glasses are very attractive and make a great presentation for guests. The base is nicely weighted, balancing the glass nicely, so that it would take quite a jostle to tip the filled glass over.We like that the Bellemain glasses are dishwasher safe and that they can also be used for desserts like parfaits or things so decadent you want to limit the amount consumed.Sample provided by the seller.",4,1

I find it hard that someone like the reviewer below would be a ""die-hard"" fan of Joy Division, but never knew that New Order was the name the band chose when they decided to carry on without Ian Curtis.  That just really sounds downright silly.  No ""die-hard"" fan would have missed that bit of information.  A casual fan that proclaims to be die-hard...well, maybe.",4,1

She said that, out of all the books, this one was the most practical, helpful book.  She said it made her feel that her feelings were ""normally abnormal"" - meaning that they were very normal feelings for an abnormal, unplanned situation - she said it helped her feel that the immense emotions associated with her loss were not hers alone but were ""normal"" for such a very difficult situation and that others had survived the grieving process.

Realism is fine and it does have some redemptive value to be sure as well as spotlight certain issues, but again I found this one to be too depressing and just too ""dark.""  I have probably read almost all Kingsbury's novels.  I like them and I recommend them, but probably not THIS one.",2,0

Watching this film on cable yesterday, the movie doesn't once fall into the campy column.  I can't say the same for the rest of the series.  To tell you the truth I think that they should have stopped at the one movie.  But still, this movie has everything, laughs, lite-suspense, and just an all around good, clean family fun.",5,1

While it is not a &#34;full blown&#34; novel, Jack and Hope while young, embrace that &#34;sends your heart a fluttering&#34; feeling that love can do to you!

Everything about it was superbly done--the author was very familiar with France's landscapes, cuisine and culture.

I can understand these being missed a couple of times, but it was all through the book. I also didn't like the way the author would stop in mid-sentence to give the English word for things like &#34;fash or ken&#34;. Most people who read this type of novel already know what those words mean and really if you want to do that, please don't keep doing it for the same words over and over.I would have given this a 5 star rating if not for the things mentioned above.

The heroine is very silly and imprudent in behavior and the hero did not particularly appeal to me either.  Seems to me pretending to be dead because your face has been disfigured in an accident shows a very superficial character.Setting the time period in the 1800s did this book no favor either because nothing and no one in it seemed to fit the era.  I had just finished reading Anna Campbell'sSeven Nights in a Rogue's Bed (Sons of Sin), which also has a Beauty and the Beast theme, before picking up this book by Montgomery.

Lovely characters and quirky locals -  I hope she continues to revisit Blue Moon junction.  It was great to see Loch and Ginger again and I hope we see the birth at some stage in the future!  I got a bit confused with the Hooperation references - was this supposed to be cooperation?  And Downton Abby maybe Abbey?  But didnt detract from the book.  My only complaint was it finished too soon - I would have liked to have some chapters on how she got on living in such a big family!  The children were so cute...  Please keep revisiting Blue Moon Junction Ms St Clair!,5,1

Before each video there is introduction and commentary by the Hollies  mostly Allan Clark and Graham Nash  and is all VERY interesting.The quality of the videos is Pretty damn good considering the years and the songs still sound wonderfully Vibrant and Fresh.It's very cool to finally see the guys singing their songs as they looked back then  and then to see them NOW  Allan Clark always had one of the best RnR voices EVER  and Hollies harmony cannot be missed  you know it it sec you hear it.  The Hollies ROCK  Then and Now and ALWAYS  must own collection for any music fan.Wish the Company who did this would Do a Collection by the other BEST group of the 60's  THE SEARCHERS,5,1

Diana can come off as too amazing until you think about who she really is.  She's supposed to be perfect.  Literally.  The villains she faces here are great and in great numbers.  The one drawback to this book is that vast number of characters are sometimes overwhelming.  The art, mainly by Drew Johnson, is fantastic and underrated.  Added to that are truly gorgeous covers by J.G. Jones.  Overall, a great read that should be considered among some of the best Wonder Woman stories.",4,1

She was naive when it came to Marcus' true intentions...but then again she wanted him just as much as he wanted her but supposedly, she's madly in love with Jayson.

But anyway, this movie is great.By the other hand, the spanish dub is from SPAIN, it's awful to hear a movie with that accent, they should've used the Latin American dub, because in Spain they use PAL, so, they'll never buy this DVD.

In fact, through this training program, I have lifted my PR on a 5k from 36:17 (a time I ran twice) to 28:56, hitting my goal of a 5k in under 30 minutes. So far so good with the Galloway.

It focuses on the first three wives (with Anne as the centerpiece) but Catherine of Aragon plays a sizeable role in this film, and Jane Seymour appears later on.The actress for Anne did a nice job with the role and the story itself is fairly well-written. The costumes and backgrounds are visually pleasing, and while this story has a few historical inaccuracies, it is definitely a lot more accurate than the 1933 film. My favorite scene is near the end where Anne gets all fired up and vows that her daughter will be a good ruler (and it did come true) The dynamics between the actor and actress who played Henry and Anne worked out quite well for this film.",4,1

5921104,A Triumph!,"on this (sadly, their final) album, Immortal's sound becomes even tighter and more refined than previous releases. thanks in part to a superior recording job that allows the power of the music to shine with cold precision and not lose a bit of the grim atmosphere. things get off to a very brutal and fast start with ""One By One"" which sets a killer tone for the record. things slow down to a mid-paced stomp for the catchy anthem of ""Tyrants"" an instantly likeable song that has one of the best guitar hooks that Abbath has ever written. and it should be noted that the vocals are some of the most unique and distinctive in the black metal world. opting for a throaty, gurgling voice that is mostly spoken rather than screamed, Immortal frontman Abbath may sound like a gargoyle version of Popeye; but his icy cold voice suits the music so well and has really set this band apart from the masses.

I love the dark moodiness of ""Since You Went Away"" and plaintive ""Night Without Sleep"", but the standout track is the closer ""Don't Look Now"". BLISTERING wah-wah guitar and an instantly infectious melody. An absolutely KILLER track. Should be in heavy rotation on every AOR and classic rock station.

This fact is part of the tension in ""Over the Edge."" Bergreen can't decide whether Magellan should be more scorned for his ill treatment of the crew or admired for the greatness of his navigation and ballsy achievement.The book reads more like a contemporary magazine story than your standard turgid historical work, as if Bergreen was writing about something 30 years ago instead of hundreds of years ago. It feels fresh. And it's got enough plot elements to keep anyone happy, even if you have no interest in navigation or exploration -- political intrigue,(...), travelogue.",4,1
8819276,Better than the Original,"Although the presentation is not as stylish as the original, I prefer this version.

Got me to go back and look at old authors like Theodore Stugeon and all that ilk.can't recommended this highly enough.  Its great sci-fi that has been lacking, to my knowledge, in this genre.  I, personally, dont count the dragons and sword old mythology as sci fi anymore. But this certainly is.His 'aliens' are somewhat amusing and the whole premise is a nice twist!  You cant go wrong for this amount of money and his works are worth the full (you know what I mean) price and I would gladly, now that I know of Mr. Harris, buy them at full rate (said me, the really poor guy)",5,1
4810223,A rare treat,"I have read every single book by Mr. Blake out there now. I happened to read the Assassin series the last, and I have to say what a way to complete Blake reading spree.King of Swords, in my humble opinion, is the best work by Mr. Blake so far. It's a lot darker than any of his other works - and for this reason, it's not my favorite book by him. See, I don't like dark grim tales in general. They make me depressed... more. But how beautifully and richly dark it is! Like a kind of rich dark chocolate. It's the perfect analogy for me. I don't like chocolate. But I do and can appreciate a great piece of dark chocolate, a very rare occasion. King of Swords is one of those phenomenal rarities. What a treat.",5,1

822190,Deeply moving and unforgettable,"There is a lyricism and rhythm to Sebastian Barry's writing that is so beautiful, it takes your breath away.  In the case of ""A Long, Long Way"" which is about a young man's experiences of the horrors of trench warfare in WWI, Barry's telling of the story does nothing to diminish the brutality of this war and everything to humanise the young soldiers who were sent to fight it.  Willie Dunne, just turned 18, is like young men everywhere.  It so happens that his transition from boy to man takes places in one of the most ghastly settings of modern time.  This is his life and Barry gives us his perspective in the most powerful and moving way.  He also gives us new eyes to see and weep for Willie Dunne and the millions of others like him whose sacrifice is recorded on the cold war memorials around the world.",5,1
8849606,Snore Fest,"I saw this film a while ago, and still have nothing good to say about it.  I almost didn't bother even watching the whole thing, it had me yawning.  The music is repetitive and annoying.  The focus was on the character's downward spiral thanks to drug use, and didn't accomplish portraying the tragedy that is the death of dreams well at all. The characters failed to move me.  It seemed to me they never had anything going for them to begin with, and thus not really anything to lose.  It just seems like a film you'd show someone to scare them away from drug use.",1,0

5090928,Really funny!,I picked up this book a while ago and just got time to read it. That being said I wish I would have gotten to it sooner. The jokes in the book were hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud in public and getting the crazy look from people around me. It really was great.That being said I gave this book 4 stars because the lack of communication went on for a little too long in my opinion.

945450,Partly True,"There are a few main ideas that are very useful in this book. The 80/20 principle has a lot of truth to it. Doing 2 or 3 most important things per day has really helped me. Hiring out work when possible, and sticking to your very best contacts and clients (part of the 80/20 thing) seems like it can really help us with our business. These are worth a quick read of the book.On the other hand, much of what the author presents is personal experience from the perspective of getting what you want out of life. He is free to choose that life-style, of course, but these ideas are so much more powerful and even fulfilling for the individual, when applied to creating a life-style where we have time to serve, build solid relationships, and become great people.",4,1
3882331,Soooooo Mad!!!!!,"This book started off wonderfully for me! It was a cute love story between two best friends and I really liked that concept. Then they have to go off to separate colleges and they agree to start fresh and not be girlfriend /boyfriend.  This was okay but when Laney started to get mad at Evan for certain things and she basically was being a hypocrite that's when the book went downhill. Laney meets a new guy.... Dane:( and is instantly &#34;comfortable&#34; with him (something that has never happened before). I really didn't mind the love triangle but this author made Laney out to be kind of whorish who played with two guys emotions. Yes she did feel remorse but if you really love someone then you don't get involved with anyone else, because that person would be consuming your every thought. Okay writing but the plot made me give this book 2 stars.",2,0

1905173,Loved the inside story.,"Bill Carter does what very few authors nowadays do: he breaks out words that I am forced to look up. For that reason alone, I love his work.By all accounts, this is a book that had no right to be written. If you stop to think about it, NBC's stated motive for going about the transfer of The Tonight Show as they did in 2004/2009 was to prevent a repeat of 1993. It didn't quite work out that way, and that's funny in and of itself, as is NBC's continued inability to get out of its own way. Alternatively sad, funny, and historical treatise on certain people and things in television, Carter turns in another gem about the late night battlefield. Can't recommend highly enough.",5,1

Landscape shots make it so.I waited until I got this DVD, keep watching for it to come out.Great script.  Cast perfect except for Cage.  I am NOT a fan of his.I remember years ago that Olympia had her Oscar stolen.  She deserved it.  Cher did as well along with the script.1 thing I do NOT like about this edition of the film.

This is a good action filled story but the on again off again of the romance was a smidge tiresome.

There are several books in this series and the only problem I had was getting them in the right order. But I really enjoyed reading about this family, and the love they had for one another.

Finally, Batman has been made the way it should have been.  Batman Begins puts Batman into the real world, while at the same time perfectly capturing the mystique of the comic.  Congratulations Christopher Nolan.  First the casting of Christian Bale was right on.  I've seen Bale in many pictures from Shakespeare to psycho, so I was confident he would do a good job, but he did better than expected.  He captured the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly.  The rage that shows on his face is at times totally intense, but he easily plays the fop (the scene where he pretends to be drunk is fantastic).  This movie dazzles in its simplicity.  The story is strong,the special affects are not overdone and the acting is perfect.  Plus it sets up perfectly for a sequal.  Well done all involved.",5,1

However, any mature gay man must be insulted by this cliche-ridden piece of fluff.  Were it funny, it might be worth it; but even the jokes are tired, shop worn gay laugh lines that we've all heard/read many times before.

8415922,If You Read One Book This Year...,"Read this one.There are very few books that make me emotional. Reading about Dally&#8217;s life and his viewpoint of the world is an eye opener for even the most hardened souls. I don&#8217;t think I can describe, in words, what I feel after reading the end of this book.The reader meets a man named Dally with a life that is harder than most could imagine. His thought patterns and his emotional reactions were alien to me, but at the same time I could feel for him. It was, at times, frustrating to see how other characters reacted to him in the book, and I know that it made me a more understanding person.I think the book should come with a warning that it&#8217;ll make you stop and think about your own life. It will make you wonder what it is that others are thinking around you, and how they view the world. This is honestly one of the best books I&#8217;ve read in my lifetime, and I hope to see more from this author.",5,1

I read the book about a year ago and thought it was an interesting read.The dip is nothing but an intellectual exercise until you actually go through it. I recommend having it in the emergency section of your business books. I often go back to it to read bits of it to reassure myself that my current state is temporary.I also believe that this the type of book where Godin thrives. He's helping us address a problem rather then trying to create social change. It is also digestible enough to be read in a train ride, and not interrupt a workday.",4,1

There are too many shades of gray and even a couple of color thrown in for good measure.The book is entertaining, have a couple of surprises and twists, leaves you guessing until the last page and is generally worth it.I especially liked the afterword, which reflects the current division in American politics: you are either extreme right, extreme left or a fool (the words most used for the third group cannot be published...).

5913046,Sign Of Things To Come?,"The latest Wumpscut full length reveals, perhaps a new direction.(Actually, my rating would be 4 1/2 stars if that were possible). It still has the typical dark Wumpscut mood to it but as a whole the work is slower and perhaps less confrontational and unlike what is stated in one of the reviews below, it isn't close minded to be aware that there are some &quot;mainstream&quot; undertones to the songs. However, this is by no means a mainstream work at all. It's perhaps just a more mellow cd than previous works (if you can call anything by Wumpscut &quot;mellow&quot;). I just fear that this may be the sign of things to come in the future. I hope not, I would hate to see those undertones become overtones on the next release.

5012580,very unique,I know it takes courage for Christian authors to obediently write books that would broach normally taboo subjects within the church and this author has done just that.At first I myself was taken back at the brash words the author used to describe prostitutes but I realized that it's because we've adapted ourselves to the political correctness words of this world and during the era this book is about those words were common.The characters were well developed and the characterization of God's forgiveness and restoring abilities were perfectly illustrated but I did feel like in a couple of areas there were subjects started or people talked about  with no final conclusion or mention of them again.All this to say it was a wonderful book and more like them should be written,5,1

4198785,A great book for non-denominationalism,"This book was great in the highest sense of great.  A great book is one that has thoughtful material as well as it being well written.  This book is both.  It talks about the push to decentralize organizations and the beauty or influence that these organizations are able to have.  It is a great defense for the church being non-denominational.  Personally, I saw a lot of parallels to non-denominationalism in the book.  It is not a church book, but speaks loudly to a church world.  That the church should be a organization that is more like the starfish than the spider.  In fact, you see the first century church functioning like the organizations that are highlighted.  I highly recommend this book, one of the best books of the year for me.",5,1

But when the credits start rolling and you  start doing whatever you're doing it grips you because this film makes you think! (which is a sign of a great movie!) What I like about the movie is it goes straight to the point no scene is in this movie as a filler, and all the actors don't seem to be acting they just simply are (what they're playing!) And the scene that touched me the most is where the Colombian hostess (who offered Maria shelter in her time of need)is explaining how one gets homesick in the U.S. but when one gets to send money back home after receiving one's first paycheck (how it affects you as the provider of the family) that just rips your heart right out.but because the acting is nuanced you have to pay attention to know where she is coming from!

I love how their puzzles are so simple, yet really make you think about the best way to solve them.  And, in my case, too often I overthink the problem and therefore, miss the solution.Their puzzles are not easy, by any means.  They are all challenging for sure.

Her hair was actually long enough for locks of love, but since it was her first (and only) haircut in seven years, the ends were actually baby hair.I did like this story about Sophie, but wish that it had focused on both sides of the story instead of only Sophie's side. We meet the recipient of the hair at the end. I'm not certain if it could have been done with this age group, but carrying a parallel story with both the girl needing hair and Sophie having too much hair might have made this a deeper story and might have inspired more people to consider locks of love and locks for kids.A nice story, but leaves my granddaughter with questions for me like, ""Why doesn't the little girl have hair?""",4,1

6470437,"Excellent in Daytime, Flash is underpowered","This camera takes awesome pictures in the daytime. However, at night in my home, I saw poor performance from the flash particularly when you zoom in.  I had multiple shots that were too dark or blurry even some when the subject was about 6 feet away.  It was kind of hit or miss if the shot was awesome using the flash.  These bad shots occured with two regular lamps on in the evening. I just wish Kodak would have beefed up the flash and added a light assist for focusing.  If so, this would have been my favorite.  The movie mode is excellent.I decided to return it and get a cannon A85.  This kodak camera lacks picbridge, manual focus, white balance in auto, beam focus assist for low light focusing, memory is on bottom (bad for tripod shooting), must use kodak lithium ion battery (cannon uses AA's).  The cannon flash is much better than the kodak and I am more satified.  The video mode on the 7440 is superior to the A85, but for pictures, the A85 rocks.Giving it 4 stars in generous, should have been 3.",4,1
1810778,A really good read,"I loved the first book because it was something a little bit different (and yet still fitting into the vampire/werewolf mythology) from the other paranormals that I've read. I like Kitty because she's both strong and weak at the same time - which is a lot more real, more human, than these paranormal characters are sometimes. So I was really looking forward to the sequel. Good news! The sequel does not disappoint. More of what I loved about the first book (though she wasn't on the radio as much, so I missed that a little), new characters introduced (Luis!), and Kitty being forced to become more public than she already was. Lots of action, character development, a little sex - all in all it was a great book. This is definitely a series that I'll be buying new as soon as each book comes out. I'm so happy that there will be at least two more Kitty adventures. I look forward to seeing where Kitty goes next.",4,1
6742256,nice cheap amp,I have been using this to drive my bathroom built in speakers for 2 years now.

I would buy this amp again.,5,1
3453205,"FUN, and funny","This is a great little mystery with high hilarity.  Yes, there are a number of improbable scenes, a couple that are Impossible-Over-The-Top, but it's all in good fun and keeps the pages turning. It was nice to read about a 45 year-old-heroine who had a lot of life and love left in her, with perhaps too great a sense of adventure and not enough sense to stay out of trouble.  Karen Cantwell takes soccer mom to a whole new level.  I really enjoyed the romantic aspects of this novel; they fit in seamlessly and were as much a mystery as the mystery!  If you need an escape or a great beach read, this might very well be it.  Highly recommended!",5,1

3572338,Trilogy review,"I found these to be a fun trilogy to read. It's not like every day Paranormal,It puts a twist on something old and makes it new. The Carters were so fun and crazy though all of it. Put it this way I finished the first one then started the second almost right after and the same with the 3 rd. I just could not seem to put it down. I was so bummed when the story ended. However, I am so glad I found a new Author and a great set of books to read.So many fun twists and turns, These are for anyone looking for a good Paranormal trilogy!Gave all stars!",5,1

4958111,Self-promotional pamhlet,The major point this booklet touches is showing that now anyone can publish a book and reach a niche (long tail is not for music anymore).Some people will write bestsellers but most of us may want to use a Kindle book to attract customers to a website and get them on a list to market to. This is what is happening here as well. There were a few marketing ideas worth remembering.Don't expect a how to guide. You will need to buy other books for that.,2,0

3246682,Indeed - Senior Dogs are so Special!,I was given this book as a gift and fell in love with every dog on these pages.  Being an avid dog lover with a huge soft spot for those pups with the snowy faces makes reading each of these stories a delight.  And not all of them will make you cry - many will make you smile with joy at the lives they've lead and the spirit in which they grow old.  They are all beautiful!  I only wish all my dogs would live to become seniors - they are just so special.  Read some of these stories and you will see how special they are...I've since bought six copies of this book to share with friends...do yourself a favor...buy yourself a gift!,5,1
1025932,A must read for those in the college/university world.,"Even those who aren't or never were in the academic world, I still highly recommend this book.  The accounts, written by Harvard students and professors, will greatly encourage those who have struggled with their faith on the intellectual level (as opposed to the social and/or physical level for which countless books have been written, i.e., suffering).  The accounts are extremely well-written and often profound (after all, these are Harvard students and professors).  I can't express how much this book has meant to me on my intellectual spiritual pilgrimage/journey.",5,1

Look out for puns and other word play plus multiple meanings of words (often not the first meaning you think of).",5,1
7902259,"sturdy, functional, a great lunch companion!",I really like this lunch set.  I have used it for baby carrots and apple slices with almond butter in the little sauce container.  It worked great!  a perfect size for my serviing portions!  I have also used it without the divider to hold fresh salad and put the dressing in the sauce container.  The seals on these is wonderful and never once worried about salad dressing leaking out into my lunch bag (as has happened in the past.  You know the lid is on right when it snaps into place. The extra rubber ring makes a tight seal and then the outer red ring on the lid keeps it firmly snapped into place.the one think I wish it had was an extra lid for the interior divider piece so you could use that as a third container if desired (rather than just nesting it inside the one rectangular container).  still I really like this set and think I'll get some more of these.  This was my first set of OXO containers and won't be my last.  Good quality and very functional!,5,1
5448614,Great ending to a series!,I absolutely loved this whole series.  This book was a great ending to Sienna and Harrison.

758607,Loving Segu,"I fell in love with the main character. His adventures and misfortunes kept me intrigued. I learned so much about the land and the structures of the different tribes and kingdoms, that I have used the book for reference.  I spoke with Ms Conde and told her I was disappointed with the fate of one  character and she merely said, &quot;It had to happen.&quot; I felt the  heat of the land and the warmth of characters and the deep belief in the  different faiths of the many regions she covered. This is a must read.",5,1
8439605,Feel the Heat!,"HEAT is definitely a way to describe these our main characters in this story.  From the moment they meet, they are pulled together by a sexual heat that cannot be denied.Zoe has come to meet with Dominick seeking his permission to refurbish a resort that is on his property on the island of Ancora.  He is Prince in name only, but contracts were signed nearly 30 years ago by his grandfather, giving him final approval to preserve the ecology of the island.Zoe and Dom are both independent, self-sufficient and definitely hard headed.  From the very beginning, the banter between them is full of innuendo and all out battle. There are no filters here to dilute their intentions.  It is this basic honesty that also draws them together with their &#34; no bulls**t attitude.This book ended up being very entertaining.  What more can you ask for besides a drop dead gorgeous prince, an exotic island, hot sexy love scenes, and an intrepid heroine?",4,1
2568078,Good concept and story ruined by sloppy writing and editing,"I was really enjoying the story of the Artemis Fowl series, but I found I kept getting pulled out of it by the sloppy writing and editing. Everything from inconsistencies (in the second book there's mention of a purple gel which is described as orange on the next page), incorrect words (""Root was loosing his cool.""), and an over-reliance on adjectives (although, to be fair, I suppose that might be excusable as the book's targeted at a younger audience).I can only recommend this book if you can get past this sort of thing.

2897638,Pure Garbage! Don't waste your money...watch the terminator instead!,I just can't believe all the good reviews that this book received! It's like Precious was on some ole Terminator type Sshh. I got to the part where she was trying to make a run with the million $ and Tommy and another guy was chasing her in their veichles and that was all I could stand. I closed the book and vowed not to read another page. I have nothing but pure love for Urban stories but at least have the story line connect with our urban  lifestyle. This was just to far fetch! Here you have Precious who is a virgin she using her neighbor Jamal to practice sex on and she masters it to the tee. Now she uses it the same way her drug addicted mom did but with class.

This movie is very well acted, the script is very good, mosty marrital strife, but there is some levity.  It is a very good movie and I highly recommend this movie to others who like drama dialog driven movies.  This isn't the normal fluff you expect from Rob Reiner.  Pfiffer and Wilis were very good and had good chemistry in both hating and loving each other.  This movie, again is for those that like drama, dialog movies, mostly for married or serious relationship folks who are 30 plus and have a mature aspect of the up and downs of relationships.

8922791,"Funnier than American Beauty, and more believable.","This movie is a scream. The comic timing is almost perfect. The humor is close to the pain, and that's what propels this movie forward from incident to incident in Enid's life.As she almost leaves high school, Enid is her own person, filled with bravado and vulnerability. She's wandering around, tragically unsure of where she wants to go and how to get there.I've met Enid several times in my life. Maybe that is why I became so fond of her in this movie, why I had such high hopes for her, and why I didn't want the movie to end. For that matter, all of the characters in this movie are familiar and sometimes all too real.Both Ghost World and American Beauty involve the collision between a middle aged man and a young woman, but otherwise have little in common. American Beauty started with an almost realistic portrayal of a man in a midlife crisis, and ended up as a wad of cartoon cookie dough. Ghost World began life as a comic book portrayal of a young lost soul, and resulted in a movie that is creme brulee.",5,1

When playing the game, the owl you see in the icon here is made up of many other smaller items. When it first opens it seems like it would be too hard to find and click the items. You can scroll in on the page to get a closer look. I have seen reviews screaming about the app's internet access and spyware.

3169710,"A mean, bloody-minded version of the Batman-Joker mythos","""The Joker"" by Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo(DC Comics, 2008)-------------------------------------------------------If you're looking for a Joker story that's grittier, gorier and more gruesomely upsetting, this ""true-crime"" version of the eternal Joker-Batman rivalry may get your blood running. I have to confess, I found it a little too ""Vertigo""-y for me, like DC's fabled trip-out-the-reader imprint, which I sort of outgrew a while back. Not really into Bermejo's purposefully grotesque artwork, either, but overall I suppose this book was okay. Obviously, the intent was to capitalize on the Heath Ledger/Dark Knight movie interpretation of the character as a crazy guy wearing smeary make-up (as opposed to the original Joker, whose face and flesh were disfigured in a chemical accident...) and for fans of that version, this book will have a big payoff. Gnarly, mean, disturbing version of Bats, as well. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain book reviews)",4,1

6040015,Why this octogenarian purchased the Essential Glenn Miller,"I am a long-time fan (at 83 years young) of the swing bands that I grew up hearing.  As a budding trombonist I also favored Tommy Dorsey and Jack Teagarden, and others.  The music of Glenn Miller however became the music of our &#34;greatest generation&#34;, those who fought for our freedom in World War 2.  His untimely death while enroute to a USO appearance was a shock to all of us.  The quality of the recordings is excellent and the set is a very good anthology of his band's many hits.  I would recommend it to anyone in my age group to stir up memories of our youth, and to music historians looking for a representative sample of why swing became so popular in the '30s and '40,",5,1

The parts about their new restaurant adventure are fine, but the real intriguing pages of the book have to do with the actual genocide that occured in 1994.The author finding out that one of his new restaurant workers killed some of his neighbors is riveting.  Readers will also find out that Rwanda is the most crowded country in Africa, and it's nickname is &#34;Land of 1000 Hills.&#34;The book deals with the history of Rwanda's Belgian colonization, and how Rwanda and Africa itself continue to transform themselves.A good read and well worth the effort.

It's like she says to herself, &#34;I wonder what it would be like to be ....&#34; and then finishes these sentences: A woman getting (or making) nuisance phone calls; A person in a relationship waking up with someone other than their partner; a husband and wife still holding hope that their long-missing daughter might return to them ... alive. And more. She takes us into these people's lives, with vivid description that create scenes so visually and emotionally real. And best of all, she surprised me Every. Single. Time. Crawford has a dark side and a funny side and an emotional side and a compassionate side and all these come through in this collection. It's awesome.",5,1
8676385,Good Movie!,"Playing for Keeps was a good movie, funny, romantic, and had a messsage to not give up on ur dreams. Three high school graduates from the Big City decided to turn a run down hotel into a rock n roll resort. Though it took them alot of time & patience, they accomplished that goal. Though the slimy Chemical owner & Cromwell tried to buy the land to put a Chemical plant, they never failed in doing so. Though the people of that suburban town didn't like them they are here to stay! I recommend this movie for anyone who likes to watch comedy. Trust me you will like Playing for Keeps too:)",5,1

1759972,Northwest of Earth,"Northwest Smith is the prototype SF rogue adventurer, wandering through the Venusian swamps and Martian deserts of pre-space exploration SF. Leigh Brackett's John Eric Stark is the next generation, and Han Solo is a long way down the road. (Note also this is where the song and title &#34;Green Hills of Earth&#34; originate.) The book is a collection of all the short stories, mostly published in the 1930's, and would benefit from being read one at a time between other stories. Otherwise the pattern of Smith, hard up for work, getting in well over his head, and frequently needing to be rescued becomes a little obvious. But if you're a classic SF junkie, the settings alone are worth the price.",4,1

1885583,He does it again!,"If you have read the first 2 novels in the series (Dragon Delasangre and Dragon Moon) you will have come to love and hate Henri Delasangre. Knowing I would get my hands on a great story, I feared the expected turn-off to the main characters as had happened in the first two novels. It was that, ""you hate it so much you have to read it"" kind of feeling. But an all new cast is presented in this novel bringing with them a fresh start and a new story; and the possibility for many new and exciting stories to come.  Alan F. Troop is a good writer. His novels are filled with excitement and action. It is the quick and easy-reading entertainment that draws me to the Delasangre books, not the love of the characters...which can be somewhat refreshing, I think.  Take a break from those heavy tear-jerkers, and the books that leave you speechless and dumbfounded. Give these books a chance, they are very fun!",5,1
8725197,"Very Good, But Why Was it Fictionalized?","An excellent film that follows, yet also fictionalizes, the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, reportedly to attack McCarthyism's impact on intellectual discourse. The changes' link to McCarthyism are imperceptible, and undermine its credibility. Instead of attorneys William Jennings Bryan and Charles Darrow (funded by the ACLU), we get Matthew Brady (also a 3-time presidential candidate) and Henry Drummond (funded by the Baltimore Herald). Other added distractions include a fictional preacher's daughter, engaged to the high-school teacher on trial and thereby estranged from her rabble-rousing father, and townspeople supposedly antagonistic to those who came to town for the trial. Nonetheless, the film is especially moving because the underlying attitudes portrayed from 1925 remain alive and well today.",4,1

4247238,Book 2 - Awesome.  Was pulled in from the very beginning.,"I discovered Kathy Fuller with the first book in this series.  This story was about Anna learning to trust and love again after a devasting breakup.  Her story was different from other amish stories in that we learned about her health issues that may prevent her from having children and the learning to believe in herself and her new found love in Lukas.  I am very interested to see how her relationship plays out in the coming books regarding this issue.  The other story that was woven through Anna's is the story of Aaron and Elizabeth.  Aaron ran into difficulty as he was growing, landed on the wrong side of the tracks.  We learn about what he has done to change his ways, we are witnessing the love growing between him and Elizabeth.  Overall, a great story and I throughorly enjoyed it.  Weould recommend to anyone.  Well done.",5,1

It was 10 minutes from the moment I opened the carton to when my wireless network was running. I was quite impressed with the ease of setting this up. You launch the Airport Setup Assistant, answer a few configuration questions, set your password, and you're wireless!Signal strength has been good throughout my house. The Airport's elegant design and small size are also nice features. It's apparent that thoughtfulness and innovation went into this product's creation.I'm now considering getting a second Airport Express to keep inside my iBook's travel case. It would come in handy on the road.",5,1
2578078,Excellent and thought provoking,Every once in a while you find a book that makes you re-evaluate what and how you think.  This is one of those.  And it's well written and easy to read.  My wife read it before me - I couldn't get her to put it down.,5,1
2135749,Another favorite of mine in this series.,"The female lead character in this book in the series takes a detour in her character development. She becomes a minor vigilante in her crusade against drug dealers. Not killing them but just making their lives a bit inconvenient. Problem is that still draws their attention to her. But she has also drawn the attention of DPD, especially Hank and Eddie, and the rest of the Hot Bunch by getting into a gun battle right in front of Fortnum's, and they are determined to shut her down.Vance has made it his personal mission to shut her activities down. Jules just wants the drug dealers to leave her kids at the shelter and on the street alone and as usual Tex is a go on increasing the level of insanity.Probably my third favorite book in the series. A new secondary character emerges in the form of May, one of Jules' friends from the kids shelter she runs.",5,1
8358984,Philippine version of a vampire!,"Paranormal investigators Jemma and Alex are writing a book that focuses on ghosts.  When Jemma finds a journal that describes a woman going to an island in the Philippines and being enticed by spirits, she decides it would make a great last chapter for the book.  After arriving, they start getting warnings to stay away, some subtle, some not so subtle.  There's not much more I can add without giving away some good bits of the story so pick up a copy and read it!This was a very interesting book.  Before this, I had never heard of an Aswang which is similar to a vampire in Filipino folklore.  I would have loved to have had more of the history of an Aswang in the book so I could understand it better since it isn't something I've heard of before but there is a small section at the end of the book that explains it.  Overall an enjoyable read!",4,1

Compared to my previous mp3 player, it's a little warmer which is desirable because my headphone(KSC75) is a little bright sounding. But, its volume is on the weak side. With KSC75, it's on about 80-90 percent of the maximum volume all the time. KSC75 is not very efficient with its 60 ohm impedence compared to other portable headphones, but if you are using high impedence headphones, you might want to look eleswhere. You may add a headphone amp to boost the volume, but it defeats the purpose of this very portable player. Otherwise, it's an excellent mp3 player.",4,1

My memory of part what transpired in 1 & 2 was clouded until I began to read Part 3, and now I'm sitting here wishing I could move on to part 4! As an avid reader of Ashley Antoinette , I was not surprised that she was able to pen this novel without losing any of her characters or confusing her readers by doing too much. As always, she did just enough to take us into the lives of the  main characters of The Prada Plan and she let us know that she isn't finished and there is more to come. Very good job.",4,1

7939383,Doctor returns,"PLAYING DOCTOR is Kate Perry's 3rd book in her Family and Love series which is another 5 stars, in my opinion.  I highly recommend it.  It is another novel which could stand alone outside the series.  There is much more ""story"" in this book than sex which is not always the case in some of her other books.  The plot has a good time line and it's characters are once again - rich, rich, rich.  Since it is fiction .... rich and sex can be enhanced beyond real life of the working class; when you grasp this in any Kate Perry book - you will find them very good as they are well written.  Good reading.",5,1

5706156,SHM imports are terrible!!!,"First, I LOVE DREAM THEATER. They are my favorite band. Second, I am not reviewing this Dream Theater album as much as I am commenting on the SHM import version from Japan. I have this fetish for remasterings and figure 'people will do better than the original' - so I coughed up the money for this Japanese SHM-CD (and others as to save on shipping). It appears that all they did was to increase the levels on the whole album! Also, this has created a terrible boomy lower midrange while the originals have a tight and punchy sound.I have an audiophile system and can tell you that there is no improvement on the originals. In fact, the originals are textured and nuanced compared to these terrible SHM monstrosities. Save your money and get the domestic releases - they are perfect!!!",2,0

For this purpose, it works perfectly. The sound quality doesn't seem to be lacking at all, I sense no drop-off. It isn't the heaviest-duty thing ever, but it does do the job and costs very little. I'll keep using it and if anything happens down the road, I'll update this review. For now, it's everything I needed.",4,1
2894711,A guideline to making permanent changes in one's lifestyle,"Registered dietitian and motivational specialist Jill Fleming presents Thin People Don't Clean Their Plates: Simple Lifestyle Choices For Permanent Weight Loss is not a get-thin-quick fix, or a fad diet, but rather a straightforward guideline to making permanent changes in one's lifestyle and one's body. Restrictive diets don't work as a long-term weight-loss solution, because they cause the body to enter a fasting mode that burns fewer calories. What does work long term is balanced nutrition instead of just cutting out foods, a lifelong commitment to exercise - even simple exercises that can be done while driving a car - and a sincere commitment to treating one's physical body better overall. Highly recommended for anyone striving to make positive improvements in their weight management and overall physical health.",5,1

The ONLY reason I dropped it from 5 stars is that it left too many unanswered questions at the end forcing you to buy the next volume.It had an amazing twist in the middle of the book that kept me from putting it down until I finished it. I loved the characters and the descriptions were very clear so that you could smell the smells and hear the sounds of the setting.

509871,Excellent book to alert you!!,"I get the National Catholic Reporter....every week there are stories of Christians being discriminated and persecuted for their faith here in America.  In 5 or so years, I  haven't seen a one of those stories in the national liberal press.  Over the 5 years i can see it getting worse.  I am an independant, wish i could vote for either party, i say this because especially bad are democrats who seem out to attack ""real"" Christians...recent examples are laws passed to force Catholic charities and hospitals to offer (forcibly pay for) birth control, abortion, and homosexual adoptions, all against our faith.  Wake up, the day is coming when it will be illegal for pastors to preach against homosexuality or other things the liberals dont like , just like a few countries in Europe and Australia (A pastor recently went to jail for reading the Bible in church, reading from the passages that talk about homosexuality).

5666695,"Toto, I found you","This is a good example of an album where the second side is better than the first.  Even though ""Rosanna"" is a great song, the rest of the music on side one sounds exactly the same.  The songwriting for each song on side one is so similar to each other, it's not even funny.  Of course, it's melodic and enjoyable, so I'm not really complaining.Side two opens with a burning rubber guitar riff rocker, and following that is an almost Electric Light Orchesta-like pop song.  There's another song on the second side that sounds like something Stevie Wonder would do (""Waiting for Your Love"") and of course, I don't even NEED to mention the song that closes the album.  It's the song that introduced me, and I'm sure thousands of other people, to the band (no, it wasn't ""Hold the Line""- nice try, though!)Well, side two is the clear winner for me.  How many times did a band save their better material for the second half of an album?  Doesn't happen often!",4,1

2482927,great fantasy with wonderful unique magic system,"While I enjoyed the whole trilogy, I think the first one is the most fascinating as it introduces you to the world and the magic system. You follow along with Vin as she learns about her powers and the powers of those around her. This series has such an interesting and well thought out magic system with believable limits, not too weak, not too powerful. The world seems so real, the characters are all well written.The payoffs as the author answers some of the mysteries about this world are great, but often he just gives you more questions to be answered later. Just when you think you have things figured out and you know how it's all going to end, it turns a complete 180. Although the ending was fairly satisfying, the book was so good I immediately had to get the other two and was not disappointed with how he ties everything together at the end of book 3.",5,1

7423149,A lot of bang for little buck!,"*NOTE: The tablet is actually running 4.1*  Bought this on a whim at Wal-Mart the other day for $99. Needed a decently spec'd tablet with good resolution to run Commander Mode and Battle-maps for Battlefield 4. It comes nicely boxed and charged! Performance is great, as it runs commander mode wonderfully, which is pretty demanding. Battery life is excellent, the screen size is a plus and the resolution is nice! The ability to access Google Play is a big relief, and all the bloat ware apps can be uninstalled or disable which is awesome! The build quality is also very nice, thin and feels solid. I was also shocked to see it had a mini HDMI port! My one complain would be that it doesn't charge via USB, so you have to use the included power adapter which has a short cord(2 feet). Though, I guess that's a very minor problem considering the price! Overall, this tablet has blown away my expectations... so much... that I will be going back today to buy a second one for rooting purposes.",5,1

Far from being a Lefty poking fun at Righties (although Stewart -- the person -- certainly is that), this book doesn't discriminate. So if you're a humorless Lefty who cannot imagine anyone poking fun at your sacred cows, go buy Al Franken's book and allow your sensibilities to remain unchallenged. (And the same goes for the Right ... except you might want to pick up Anne Coulter or Bill O'Reilly's books.)

4228837,Defies Logic,"And by defies logic, I am not talking about reincarnation or any other supernatural element, all of which I find very fascinating.  What I mean is that plot contrivances/devices and some motivations are so poorly rendered as to be wholly inexcusable.  Moreover, there should have been noted in the book that it is the first of a triology so that the reader is not left hanging after a hurried and totally unsatisfactory ending.  Even if she intended a cliffhanger, it fails as it most assuredly was not.  Further, who gives a flying flip if Ben/Amita's cooking is horrible?  Daniel flies halfway around the world for a critical message and the short visit revolves around cooking, with no apparent symbolism.  Unless, of course, you consider it a metaphor for the author cooking up a mess.",2,0

It has the same extras as the 25th anniversary dvd but with added bonuses such as watching a live shadowcast of the film as you watch with performers from the ""best"" shadow casts across the globe.  No Tim Curry commentary which is sad.  It has a great factoid feature that pops up with very recent facts and data about the film.  I also enjoyed the blu-ray menus which have rare posters of the film that shuffle through in the back ground.  The selecting the 35th anniversary blu-ray shadow cast segments weren't that interesting and could have been better produced.  Overall a great rocky horror blu-ray and a must have if you are a fan of the film.  Wait for this to go on sale.  I don't believe its worth anything over 19.99.",5,1

7789739,"Nice quality, feel substantial","It is always difficult when looking at a picture to gauge the feel and quality of a product.I was happy to discover these are in fact substantial and are not in any way flimsy. These really are good value for money.For hygiene, the brush and the part of the handle that fits inside the holder (the part not normally visible) are moulded white plastic.We bought 3 of these because our puppies had taken to making toys out of the plastic ones these replace.The manufacturers stickers removes easily, another brand I considered had terrible reviews based on how strong their label stuck. These pulled off effortless without any residue.I would buy again.",5,1

3571031,Engaging piece of writing,"I must admit I was a little reserved about purchasing this book at first because of the poetry side of things, but from the moment I started reading I couldn't put it down and proceeded to read it in one sitting. I read alot and Slammed is the first book that has been able to bring out several different emotions out of me in a long time from a book. I cried...more than a few times through out the book but what I loved, was that it also made me laugh uncontrollably through fresh tears. The poetry side of things was interesting and engaging to read, some of it making me really think. It expressed the importance and value of family which really brought it home for me and of course the relationship between Lake and Will kept me ever so eagar for more. My Summary... I loved it.",5,1
8473764,Ray works in a funeral Parlor he is a serial Killer by night,Copy CatBy Brendan VervilleI really enjoyed reading this book. I don&#8217;t usually like crime shows or books but I thought I would give this one a try. Glad that I did .It held my attention and was a very exciting book. This is a bizarre crime story about a man who works in a funeral parlor and is a serial killer on the side. He is happy with his job until his victims start to show up as his customers in the funeral parlor. Then he decides to do a career change and move away. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes crime stories that are on the bizarre side. It will keep you captivated from start to finish.&#34;,5,1
9131520,I LOVE IT!,"I was at my sisters house and she had this dvd. I decided to try it and I fell in love with it right away and bought it the same night. I had never done pilates before especially with a resistance band and I really enjoyed that they are 10 minute work outs, so depending on the amount of time you have you can do anywhere from 10-50 minutes! Before I knew it I had already completed thirty minutes of exercise. I really enjoyed this and i would recommend this workout dvd to anyone!",5,1

8179929,Cute Book,This was a cute book. It was a very sweet romance. I loved the way the author wrote the main characters. I can't stand a weak h. Quinn (h) was a very straightforward woman and really loving but didn't take crap. Craig (H) was also very loving and wasn't willing to give up. My only problem with the book was that there were a few formatting issues. Four or Five times the sentence would just end with no finish. Also sometimes a characters name would change. Example: She would be thinking about Craig and then it was Jacob's name. Even with that I was not deterred. I would purchase a book from this author again.,4,1

Definately worth the cost of the limited edition!",5,1
6118142,A refreshingly new NUTCRACKER production,"Some say that the music of a country is best performed by artists in that country and this brilliant effort supports that view.  The dancing, lavish and colourful sets, orchestral playing under maestro Gergiev, are all top notch.  The choreography by Krill Simonov is new and different to that seen in most productions and this gives a freshness to the production.  Quite a few dances are traditionally performed by solo artists but here are danced by two or three together. Many of the presentations have new, elaborate and effective staging with great effects.  The music is very familiar to me and the overall result in 24 bit surround sound is both entertaining and musically satisfying.  A 12 year old ballet student and her family looked at it with us and everyone voted it ""great"".  Thoroughly recommended.",5,1
1141114,Good Read,"If you a looking for a good story, I recommend it.  If you are looking for high literature, like some of the reviews seem to be looking for, then read War and Peace.This story is interestingly different from the beginning.

2760730,Was Christ really resurrected?,"That is the question that Charles Foster asked himself. Mr. Foster takes us on a journey as he takes part in a two sided argument about whether Jesus Christ was resurrected or not from the grave. In his book the Jesus Inquest he writes for and against the resurrection. After researching in libraries and visiting tombs, he takes us on a journey that many of us have been on. We have at one time or another asked ourselves if Christ has risen from the dead.By taking us through the medical evidence, burial practices, artifacts and many other evidences he gives the evidence for and against in a trial type setting. He asks and answers the questions from both sides of the resurrection debate. So what was the verdict? What does the evidence show? Did Christ come back from the dead? There is only one way to find out. You need to pick up this book to find out the answers to these questions. I guarantee that this book won't leave you hanging.",4,1

7920523,This Little Piggy Stayed Home,"I read ""Serial"" before I read ""Truck Stop"", as I suspect most people did since Serial was a free Kindle book. I sort of saw Serial coming as the second installment as I feverishly read Truck Stop. As I read Truck Stop I was locked onto my Kindle like Candi with an I was locked in stocks in the semi. What a terrific work of suspense blended with horror and cheese curds. Possibly the most attractive feature of Kilborne's prose is that its pictures are painted perfectly with just the right words. They are uniquely his and not a poor man's Stephen King like so many other horror writers I could name.Instead of rehashing the whole story from beginning to end and labelling it a review, I'll say this: I greatly enjoyed the characters, the suspense and the story. Kilborne carefully plotted and planned for this. This is a terrific story and I can't wait for the third installment.",5,1

They'd been best friends forever, so why was she moving to St. Louis and leaving him? When she won't take his calls, he really becomes worried and goes to St. Louis to see what's wrong.

7392519,"Great for video, has audio problems","After all of the great reviews, I was excited to get this product.  I cannot add anything to what other reviewers have said, other than the caveat that the BDP-103 drops audio (about 3-5 seconds) periodically, regardless of the type of media it is playing.  I have tried the recommended fix of changing the audio format settings to &#34;LPCM&#34;, which has lessened the problem, but not eliminated it.  Very disappointing in such an otherwise quality product.",2,0
6400279,"Great bra, but not perfect","From past experience, I've learned that Panache bras tend to run a bit small in the band and are not very stretchy, like some other brands are (Freya especially).

My only real complaint is that it's a bit wide on me and high on the sides, so my armpits get poked slightly.",4,1
5350471,And I thought I knew where this was going...,"I have read many books and love a good thriller or murder mystery.  When I read the reviews I thought it was a good book to begin.  I was definitely drawn in.  The thing I liked the most about the book was the fact that it was not in the least predictable.  Just when I was sure I had it figured out, it took another twist and turn.  The ending was totally unexpected.  If you are looking for a good  read that will have you thinking about it long after you've read the last page, hold on to your hat you're in for a wild ride.",5,1
6705599,Useless,The features of this product are great...the problem is the clock constantly freezes and/or locks up.  Twice the alarm did not go off because the clock had frozen.  I returned the product for a replacement thinking maybe I got a dud.  Well the replacement does the same thing.  So I emailed the company to see what could be done.  Three suggestions were given:1.  Make sure you are using the iPhone dock adapter (well duh)2.  Turn the power off before inserting the phone (well ok but not sure how this would help the clock freezing in the future...it wasn't freezing when I was putting the phone in).3.  Power cycle the clock to reset...(ok I do this EVERY time it freezes).So bottom line works great to listen to music...but if you need a clock or an alarm (which is probably why you are looking at an ALARM CLOCK) then this is unreliable and completely useless...just like the company's support.,1,0
348069,Eye candy for train fans,"Kindle Fire HDX.For a free app, it's very nice. It's not a &#34;game&#34;, in that there is no real goal. You can start and stop the trains, speed them up and slow them down and basically drive around. There are a number of different views, engines and tracks. The views change depending on the engine selected. My favorite is the steam engine, and altho you can't control the engine from the interior view, it's still fun to look at. I realize from the product description that this was developed for the author's son, but if this were developed a bit more aggressively, I would probably pay for additional features. There are a few issues that I notice, stuff like graphics clipping and tearing, or sound loops that don't quite loop very well. I don't know if it is the Kindle Fire HDX or the app itself which is hyper-responsive to touch controls like pinch-n-zoom, but some of the touch controls were very erratic sometimes. Either way, still nice to sit back and zone out.",4,1
8690040,"Unintentionally funny, with one great battle scene","This may be the goofiest war movie ever made, an attempt to do a WWII-style flag waver smack in the middle of the Vietnam War.  Simplistic and cliched beyond words, badly directed and acted, the central part of the picture is, nevertheless, worth the price of admission.  A long, sustained night attack on a firebase is memorably staged and shot.  Seems a little clunky now, but no one had ever seen anything like this when the movie came out.  The rest is laughable, especially the mistakes: Wayne parachuting out of plane without hooking up; smashing what is obviously a Mattel toy M-16 against a tree (see the curved ""magazine""?); and, of course, the classic ending where the Sun sets in the East.",2,0

The white bit is important as all my appliances are white and I wanted a match. The flaw in the Samsung (deficient viewing angles;color negative picture 30 off) does not exist in this TV. Its ability to grab the house WiFi is phenomenal, and I no longer need to use the Roku box in the kitchen.The first reviewer did such a great job that all my operational questions were answered, but the aesthetic, there is white and there is white; this is not an appliance bright white like the Samsung was, it is more a creamy white. We have a larger VIERA in another room so I knew in advance that I would not like the remote/setup. I think Panasonic makes it more complicated that what it needs to be.

I loved the characters, the plotting, the action scenes, the love and romance, the five brothers and their ability to totally stomp ass when needed and of course Dominus's dominance.

5677906,One of the true voices of Christmas,"There are certain singers you always hear on the radio at holiday time. Bing, Nat, Frank, Dino, Johnny, Perry, and Andy Williams. This CD consists mostly of songs that Andy himself selected. Most of them are from his red and green albums released in the 60s. Of course, his two signature holiday tunes are here, those being It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year and Happy Holiday/The Holiday Season. Other songs that I like are My Favorite Things, The Bells of St. Mary's, Ring Christmas Bells, Sleigh Ride, Silver Bells and Winter Wonderland.There are 15 songs here, but the CD clocks it at about 40 minutes or so. They had room for more material. I also like Andy's versions of Let it Snow, Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells, A Song and a Christmas Tree (The 12 Days of Christmas) and his version of Ave Maria. That would make this CD better, but it's a good selection of Andy's best. He and Johnny Mathis are arguably two of the best living interpreters of holiday music.",4,1

Extremely well researched & very well written, I found this book to be thoroughly absorbing;reading more like a novel than non fiction. The selection of included photographs was also a treat & included some things that I had not seen before in other books. If you enjoy biographys, non fiction, Florentine history, history in general, the Italian renaissance or just have an inquiring mind you will not be disappointed with this great book!

1476017,I adored this book....,"I read this book second instead of first and I have to say it was better than a &quot;Rake's Vow&quot;. Honoria was just great. Her character was well developed and you truley just loved her. Devil was an angle in diguise. I loved their interaction together. Both gave the other fair warning about how they thought thier relationship would end ~~ with Devil saying he was going to marry her and Honoria saying she most certainly was not going to marry him.The romance was great. Love scenes were not rushed. They went along with the story instead of seeming like filler. And the tracking of the murder was also pretty good. (Loved when Honoria always hit on some detail that Devil had missed.) Honoria was not dimwhitted, she proved her worth time and time again. I loved this book I could go on and on and ramble until my heart was content, but I don't want to ruin anything for you. Pick this book up and read it. You will not be disapointed.",5,1

1375518,"The ""King"" Has a Heart! A GREAT Way to Start Summer Reading!","I loved this book! Mz. Byrd really does a great job in developing the story from the many characters here. I think Eamon is the perfect soothing balm of humor and strength for Victoria who is spoiled and angry. The right love helped Victoria to find herself.It is challenging to deliver a series and Mz. Byrd has done an excellent job in the premiere story! I can't wait for part 2!Great story, great characters and this book is a great summer/beach/park/vacation read.

7548528,Worth every penny if just to cut those onions!,"Like other reviewers, I hate cutting onions, and I was thrilled with the nearly instant work that this chopper made of two medium onions. I just chopped each in half, took off the outer couple of layers, and threw them in. A couple of quick pulses and I had dry eyes and very nicely diced onions ready for my cooking project.I agree with the complaints about the inside top of the unit being hard to clean because it is attached to the motor. It would have been so much better if there was some kind of a liner to toss in the dishwasher. But I am sure I will manage to get the top clean enough for my standards. The only problem will be taking care of it right away before food dries on it.I read through every single review to see how other people are using this little machine. Lots of great ideas. I hope to try them, and I will never cry alone in my kitchen again, no matter how many onions need to be chopped.",4,1

The machine rattles because of the screw.  Since it was a bargain at under $20, it was something I could live with.  I didn't care for the main recipe as I prefer my grandmother's.  3/4 cup semolina flour to each egg- don't forget salt too. Let the dough rest in a plastic bag for at least 30 minutes in fridge and the roll will be smoother.  Remember, never wash and dust with flour if any sticking.I would buy again.",4,1

It took the music to a whole notha' level.I don't give it 5 stars because there were a couple sections where it was a bit slow, and a bit repetitive. But I was surprised by the album. I am a big fan of Erykah Badu, and this album is in the Badu tradition. There were some great solos and great horn lines.

The story leaves you anticipating him meeting his heart's match in life.I also like the way family is celebrated in this story!",5,1

7928414,Picks up speed and then flies to a soaring finish,"This YA oriented book was a find for a middle aged reader.  There is some difficulty with the beginning.  So much information is thrown out that I ended up putting the book down until I could give it more attention...and I can usually juggle several books at one time.  That may make this one tougher for your YA to hook onto.That said, once the characters were all introduced and a basic plot established, the story began to take flight and capture the imagination in a very strong grip.  Mira is a strong leader who improves those around her using what she learned during all those years at home.  The fact that this class ultimately pulls together into a team, not based on deals and prearranged promises but on the reliance of the strengths of the individuals working toward a singular goal, is the ultimate flight.I look forward to reading the other books in this series.",5,1
1397892,Keeps you interested,"""On Fire's Wings"" was a really good, action-packed, keep-you-reading novel from the Luna imprint, which I've found to be hit-or-miss so far.  The plot is pretty straightforward, but Golden is really setting up a complex world that you hope she'll explore more in later books.  There's also a rich history before ""On Fire's Wings"" takes place that you sort of want explained - exactly how and why did they succeed or fail on previous attempts?  I'm taking a star off because I was absolutely appalled by something that happened in the middle of the book (keep reading, you'll see what I mean), but after I got past that part and it was explained why it happened, it was a bit more acceptable.",4,1

I loved Carrie's determination and resourcefulness at finding him. I loved her time in Alaska - stuck with Finn, but trying to make the best of a strange situation. I adored Hennessey, the dog.  I liked Finn's perspective, especially when Carrie invades his privacy. A charming romantic tale that warmed my heart.",5,1

2232398,Living Mythology,"This book is an interesting juxtaposition of travelogue and mythology.  As a child, Storace was fascinated with the stories and characters of Greek mythology.  This led to a life-long fascination with Greece and Greeks, not only of the ancient culture, but as they are today.  In this book, Storace takes us on a journey to her Greece, a land that is inseparable from its mythic past.  She narrates to us stories of people she met in Greece, repeating the stories they told her, all the while relating the stories to the ancient tales from Greek mythology.  As a travel journal, the book is a little heavy on allusions and symbolism and a little light on realistic imagery.  But direct descriptions of events is not what this book is about-instead it is the personal story of how Storace finds meaning in Greek culture through her own integration of history, mythology and observation of contemporary society.",4,1

If you do not buy more chips, you can not play the game any longer.

This Spanish-language version gives homegrown accounts of the nation that has been haunted by her legacy ever since.Evita was a study in contrasts, Dior dresses worn when giving donations to the poor, too much flashing of money while lambasting the rich, and being First Lady when all she could do was act. What she lacked in theatrical talent she re-directed into a power-hunger so fierce the Argentine economy is still realing from her reign.",5,1

As Laura Hunt, Gene Tierney is visually exquisite and her performance is very convincing (in the original novel, the title character was quite different, she being rather amoral). Dana Andrews is most effective as Mark McPherson, the detective who ""falls in love with a phantom..."" Vincent Price is unlikeably weak as Shelby whose close friend Anderson explains about their mutual admiration of each-other ""We're weak and can't seem to help it"" Lastly, as Waldo Lydecker, Clifton Webb is simply excellent. A classic film noir with the inevitable twist, LAURA is a classy, ingenious film from the heart of the 40's.",5,1

This is sturdy and makes coffee well like the glass ones.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had been made in America and came with an all metal strainer.  I'm not very comfortable drinking anything that resulted from boiling water being poured over any type of plastic. When I called the Bodum people and asked them why this was not all made of metal, they told me that it was made of plastic and silicone to avoid scratching the inside of the stainless steel pot.  I don't care if the inside gets a little scratched, and so I took the all metal strainer assembly from my broken glass carafe and screwed it into the metal lid of the new pot.  Problem solved, and I can easily replace this part should I ever need to because this pot is the same size as a Bodum glass carafe and the parts are interchangable.",4,1

It's what the food means to those who cook it, those who share the meal, the pleasure he takes with his meal companions.  He isn't impressed by famous names, he's impressed by glorious food.  He passes right over San Francisco (really, he was ill), but devotes an entire chapter to a friend whose oddities and endearing kindness introduce him to our tradition of Thanksgiving and the rather generous definition of family at most large Thanksgiving tables.I'll be giving this to food-lovers as a gift, knowing they'll enjoy imagined and remembered travels, as well as the companionship of Simon Majumdar.",5,1

1353616,Prequel to Prequels,"This book describes the beginning of the Earth-Bugger conflict. In Ender's game both the First and Second Formic Wars are mentioned. This book leads up to the first formic war. Be advised that the reader is left hanging.The novel is more like Enders Game than Speaker for the Dead and subsequent books in this series. This probably explains why some don't like it. The book is an action novel not a reflective piece. Further, the book has several separate plots, some of which don't even come together in this book which makes remembering and following the separate characters very hard. (Think some of the Tom Clancy novels)Still, if you loved Ender's Game, youll love this book. Cards imaginative description of asteroid miners is masterful. I can't wait for the next in the series.Tom",5,1

7887567,Bottoms Up!,"I absolutely love a great cup of coffee in the morning with my Keurig K-Cup coffee brewer. But yet, I do feel the need to try and find easier ways to make my own coffee without having the use of problems with just going through the expensive knocks of having to buy the disposable cups. Cafe Cup is something I definitely was surprised by, when I had the desire of getting my Keurig brewer for coffee, and it was as one of the few As Seen On TV products I have seen in awhile that works well for its money. Not only does it work nicely for my coffee, but it is a great concept for anyone that doesn't want to go for the route with buying a Keurig only filter. My one gripe though is that it can be a bit messy to clean, but it is worth the money. If you have one of the K-Cup machines by Keurig, I definitely suggest you get the Cafe Cup, and use your own ground coffee for the best cup around.Price: B+Convience: B-Overall: B 1/2+",4,1

6687059,computer good so far... Amazon spec is off,"the computer is good so far... the thing is about the Amazon specas of Oct 6, 2008, the spec on this page says resolution is:1440 x 900 pixelshowever, the box printing says 1680 x 1050 and the hp.com spec says 1680 x 1050 also.so that means the font will be smaller...  I bought this computer partly based on the fact that IQ804 and IQ816 are both 25 inch screen and is 1920 x 1200.  I thought this one is 1440 x 900 and therefore it is more comfortable for it being a touch screen computer.  When the resolution is too high, the dot density is too high, making it less comfortable for using the finger to pinpoint something to ""click"" it.Turns out that 1920 / 25.5  and 1680 / 22 give about the same dot density, as both are about 75 or 76.",4,1

3681363,A fun read,"Thirty Postcards Away was translated from Spanish to English as it was written by a Spanish author who lives in Malaga, Spain as does her main character Sofia who lives in an apartment on the thirteenth floor of a high rise. Early in her move she takes the elevator and there is a handsome man in it that lives on the twelfth floor, Jamie. The two of them start a tentative relationship. Jamie is anally organized and Sophia not so much. Jamie is divorced and involved with the woman who was the other woman in the relationship. Sophia has just gotten out of a bad relationship. Plenty of humor,pathos and emotion comes through this romantic story. I'm not quite sure how to categorize it--somewhat a contemporary romance, but it has more depth than many of the other books that are categorized in this genre.",4,1
684675,A Charming Devil,"From the moment in his boyhood when the mischievous Tristan Burke climbs under eight-year-old Joan's bed to hide from her parents you just know he's going to grow up to be a devilish, heart-breaker.  Joan, the heroine, is a bit reminiscent of Penelope in Julia Quinn's Bridgerton Series, dressed in unsightly, tricked-out frocks.  But our hero, Tristan, quickly dispels that image by helping the reader see beyond that mass of flashy flounces that Joan's mother insists she wear. He has just enough swagger to be sexy without that extreme level of pomposity that tends to render so many heroes nothing short of jerky.  No jerk in this novel; just a fun, fresh and charming devil of a man capable of stripping the ""umbrella dress"" off of our heroine with his eyes...and oh so much more.",5,1

Hollywood's best (Elizabeth Taylor at an age my generation won't recognize, and Dennis Hopper in a surprise smaller role) play in this story that confronts big topics such as inter-generational transfer, racism, and faulty attempts at personal growth.It's a heavy and long movie - best seen in 3 parts over 3 nights.

I have had some that are almost flexible when they are plugged in, this one is solid. Does not move at all while plugged in.

Her excitement was infectious.I finished the series I was reading and dove head first into Tattoo Thief.  I loved it!  I'm sure there are a lot of young women who can relate to Beryl.  Don't know what to do with their lives yet not yet content with settling for the one they have.  Sadly many do settle, with regrets ((raises hand)), but accept the hand they chose.

Anyway, I picked this one up, 'cause it was really cheap and these days, you can't usually find good bands for cheap. Yeah, I know that sucks. This is a really great CD which I did not know was new, until I read the back of the case while I listened to it. Anyway, this is a solid, from-the-heart effort by an obscure 80's sensation, who hopefully will rise to glory again. Until then, I really like this CD, and Hair Metal is not the right term for this kind of music...more like alt-progressive glam.",5,1

3087994,A terrifying and necessary story,Had to give up reading (it) in bed at night and settle for lunchtime reading instead--scared me that much (and I'm not easily scared). But it's precisely because things like this have happened--and are still happening somewhere in the world--that this read is so unsettling (and only a very capable writer like Sirota can make it all feel so horribly real).

3139772,A Great Book From One Of Our Best Authors,"I am a big fan of Perotta's - most recently finishing the 2012 Best Short Stories anthology that he edited.  I primarily knew him for his novels The Leftovers and Election.  Nine Inches is one of the best short story collections I have read in years; contemporary, often very funny and touching stories that ring true, but also often offer a really pleasant surprise.  Perotta's writing is lovely and precise, and after reading this book I immediately ordered Bad Haircut, one of his earlier short story collections. Highly recommended!",5,1
783885,Chris Mooney just gets better and better,"Just finished the Soul Collectors. Sent to Amazon UK for the book since it is not available in the States, which I find infuriating!! But the book is beyond amazing. Darby is one the most intriguing female characters in this genre. Her relentless drive to find the truth and punish those responsible for unnspeakable crimes is the foudation of her personality. She is independent, honest, driven, and fearless. Couple this with her empathy for the victim, her ability to cry (when no one can see her),and the depth of her feelings to those close to her and you have one pretty amazing lady! I am a big fan of Chris Mooney and highly recommend his books. Please read them in order, starting with Deviant Ways and then The Missing, Dead Room and Secret Friend. You will not be disappointed.

It was sexy without being trashy and was well written with compelling characters.The suspense was great and took me on an emotional roller coaster. I will absolutely be buying the second book in this series.",5,1

I do flip flop between Fodor's and Lonely Planet being my favorites because each author is just different, but in this case Lonely Planet has hit it out the park. Granted there aren't a ton of travel guides (especially for New Mexico), but this one was especially funny and filled with great advice. I love the history and the quirky places it helps you find, as well as basic information. This one in particular had some great itineraries. I only wish it had included Texas as well (or at least the towns on Route 66 in Texas) since this is a great guide for those traveling on 66 or I-40.",5,1

True, this isn't great literature at its finest, but for what it is --a Romantica novelette-- it's fantastic!I thought the main character was well-written and easy to relate to, and her romantic interest was certainly an awesome fantasy! The scene is light kink, nothing remotely over-the-top or anything. Take the negative reviews here with a grain of salt; most of them didn't know what they were getting into with an Evangeline Anderson book, so they're negative about the length and simplicity (duh, it's a novelette!), or the graphic content (duh, it's erotica!).All in all, it's a sweet little story.",4,1

You could feel the chemistry between Sin and Emily right from the start, I kept thinking have sex already geesh. I loved how Sin told Emily to beg for him, they just sizzled.

3427222,"I Laughed, Sighed and Got Angry, Bring On Term Limits!","When I picked up this book I thought it would be a politically slanted snapshot of how poor things are going in Washington. I was pleasantly surprised.I felt as though I was sitting next to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and listening in on their conversations, member meetings and just walking down the hallway with them. I felt their pressure from voters back home and fellow legislators. I now better understand what is expected of each member and how many bosses they may have.One eye opener was the story about the Bureau of Public Debt and the selling of Treasury Bills and U.S. Savings Bonds, felt bummed after hearing that.Term Limits might be in our future. We need to get past special interests groups and raising re-election funds as a high percentage of a Congress member's job description.",4,1

Key west is paradise but has significant draw backs, like few jobs and low pay, and it is very expensive to live here....now if you have $$$ great place to visit/live.

His father made his money by slaughtering animals, everything Daria fights against.  Not to mention Paul's love of a good steak when it comes time to celebrate.

3564157,This book one of my favorite counting books!!,"As you can figure out by my name, I love monkeys! The book's rhyme was catchy and was more than simply counting from one to ten as it told a story about a mischievous monkey who stole items belonging to other animals and people.  For example, for number two, there is a fun rhyme about a dog hiding his two bones with a picture illustrating the dog's actions. The next picture shows the dog looking into the hole where he'd buried his bones and now it held two bananas instead of his bones. After the number ten, there is a picture showing all of the little monkey's loot. How everyone got their stolen items back would spoil the story. I had not anticipated the ending at all. Good story! Another reviewer mentioned maybe purchasing this book in paperback, and I might do that, too. This book is a keeper for sure, and is a new favorite!

My boys love looking at the pictures right after I take them and the handy screen on the back is a plus for all of us.  When you're taking pictures of three kids you sometimes can't get everyone looking and/or smilling at the same time.  With this camera I don't waste money on developing pictures that aren't up to my standards.  I wind up taking at least 3-4 pictures before I get exactly what I want and then I just go back through the photos and erase what I don't want.

I also like the fact that they are open air and do not shut you off from your surroundings.  This is an especially nice feature if you live in an urban area, IMHO. These ear buds are also very comfortable and the wind up case is a BIG plus (why couldn't Apple include something like this with theirs?)

The chart explaining what % of Daily Values means for various ingredients solved a particular longtime label reading mystery for me. My favorite aspect of the book, however, is the arrangement of the recipes by calorie count at the end of the book, making it a very useful reference for meal planning. The book also features a swappable suggested 8 day meal plan and a list of kitchen tools that every home cook will find useful.

With first cousins interbreeding you will get some very strange mutations.  I'm just surpised there weren't any physical deformaties mentioned.On the whole I have to say that I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buying it.

While the author does an excellent job, painting the characters and the scenes, the characters are very unlikeable,  She also bounces back an forth between story lines as well as the past and the present.  This makes it challenging to see where all this is headed.  And the ending leaves you cold.  I read it for book club and that was the group concensus as well.  Not one of our better selections.",2,0

The storyline degenerates into total idiocy if you ask me, with, and a SPOILER ALERT HERE !!! the lead character, playing chess with the devil for her soul, sorry, but as we say here in NZ, 'yeah, right !'

There was great character development with all of the characters.  He outlined the time frame very well and I found the story line refreshing.

8862095,River's Edge,"This movie was good, I watched it because of Ione Skye.  The subject matter was the rebellious teens and the adults that tried to act like teens.  This was a movie in my opinion about lost morals, lost hope and a wish to ruin as many lives as possible.  Parents were non existent in their child's life and the ones that were had no goals to raise their kids.For me the lack of any morals to even feel after a death is to far fetched to imagine. Keanu Reeves does his 60 ies hippie impression while trying to remain out of the influences of the rest of the group.I had a hard time liking any of the people depicted in this movie.  If Denis Harper tried to make everyone watching hate him, he did a good job.This was not an uplifting movie but I was able to enjoy Ione Skye and that is why I watched it.",4,1

Back is protagonist Jack (Obadiah Jackson), our high-action hero in the vein of Indiana Jones who heads ENIGMA, the seekers of cryptids. In this case the cryptids are the Jersey Devils, a much bandied about legend of gargoyle-like creatures equal to the lore of Bigfoot, and, in reality, claimed to have been seen by some. But in Devil&#8217;s Child, after a friend was attacked, Jack heads to New York where he begins to find the truth behind the Jersey Devil, only to be mired by political feuding with town constituencies. But this is only the beginning of finding the truth behind the myth, of the 9-foot gargoyles running havoc. This is an action/adventure through and through. Since I enjoyed Siren&#8217;s Song to the nth degree, this book is no different.",5,1
2482143,Terrific,Terrific series and terrific book.  I couldn't put it down and since reading the entire Malazan series have placed it at the top of my favorite fantasy epics list.  The characters are interesting and deep.  Often flawed but still with enough redeeming qualities to make us actually care what happens to them.  Loved this book from beginning to end.,5,1

5964210,One of the best....Ever!!!,"This CD and band is the best thing to come out of Detroit, I know Eminem and Iggy are great but Seduce represented an era, at leat for me.  They were available and awesome live.  They should be nationwide legends, it's too bad they never got the chance.  *Best Tracks: Crash landing, Accuations and The Slider (T. Rex cover)",5,1

1748752,Wonderful!,"The author writes a wonderful whimsical story.  There is a lot of catholicism in this book, but I didn't take it as an attempt to convert people (as some readers apparently did).  I believe the author was using  his experiences and knowledge as a tool to weave a tapestry of fantasy for  the reader (and no, I'm not Catholic).  I loved reading this story.  This  entire series is a pleasure to read.",5,1
2613129,"Great Band, Good CD","Two of the songs on this cd are my favorites...&#34;The Hurt and the Healer&#34; and &#34;You are I Am&#34;. Both songs are great praise songs and both are played on our local radio. The rest of this cd is good, if not spectacular. But there are songs on here that will appeal to both young and older (like me) Christians. Mercy Me is one of the top bands in Christian music today and I hope they have many more CD's on the way.",4,1
1756767,Great,"I have to say that I think that this has to be my favorite book in the series. I love how the relationship between Adam and Mercy is tested and grows and also seeing the tensions between Mercy and the rest of the pack as well. I feel by the end of the book, the pack have accepted Mercy a little more as she starts to accept them.I also loved reading about the fae. It's always interesting to see there world and even though I wouldn't want to be on there bad side (or owe them anything) I like seeing glimpses of their world.",5,1

4318819,Very appealing YA novel,"I don't know why I have started reading more YA novels recently, but I am impressed with the quality of many.  This one did not disappoint.  I gave it a try because it was free and now I am willingly going to pay to get the follow-up books.  I thought it was well written and compelling.It is about a girl who is moved to a new place where she is most definitely the outsider.  Different religion (wiccan), different way of dressing, city girl in the country, and the popular girl hates her.  It should be very cliche, but I came to really like the characters.  I want to find out what happens to them.",4,1

I had no idea what Slammed poetry was but decided to take a chance anyway. I totally lost myself in this book. This book is wonderfully written. The characters came alive and became friends I wanted to be in my life and never leave. The romance is beautiful and real.  The author makes it possible to actually feel every emotion as you take the journey with Will and Layken as they fall in love. I felt like I was young and in love again for the first time.  The real world fell away as I read the book in one sitting!  I am on to the sequel, Point of Retreat.",5,1

4770950,"Spellbinding Story - Sweet, Steadfast Heroine","I must confess to being on edge as I read this story even as I found myself captivated by the lovely Clarissa and her strong morals. She was absolutely riveting in her steadfastness as she struggled to remain virtuous against all the circumstances life threw at her.Although Trevor was a kind person in some respects, he was irritating beyond belief as he pursued Clarissa toward her possible ruin.  Ms. Farr is an excellent writer and this is one of the best of her books that I have had the pleasure of reading so far.  The rest of her books are on my ""to read"" list.",5,1

5674440,One of the best soundtracks of the 90's,"This, along with &quot;The Crow&quot; soundtrack, is no doubt 1 of the best soundtracks of the 90's.  You can't go wrong with the best bands of the 90's on 1 cd.  Chris Cornell's track is absolutely dreamy, &amp; the  Mother Love Bone track is great too.  I can hardly say 1 bad thing about  this cd except does anyone know where on earth that Lovemongers song  appears?? I've watched that movie tons of times &amp; have never heard it.  I think they could've added the Cult track, although it didn't really fit,  but neither did the Hendrix track.  Either way, this cd rules.",5,1

If you're looking for a classic cat-and-mouse suspense movie, this is definetely one that should be at the top of your list. Starring the master of fright Vincent Price, this movie includes many tricks and gimmicks that aren't so much scary as entertaining. Even with the poorly rendered haunts and spooks, it's easy to see why Price has reigned the haunted silver screen. Once you get past the true-to-era ""special effects,"" you'll ultimately become a fan, and fall under the spell of the mesmerizing Price. Easily realizable as to why he is such a favorite to stars such as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.",5,1

After the last book in this series, the focus shifts between the lives of the 14th and the pace of discovery of why the Alien War is occurring.  Great plot developments and the clever armor redesign during the book, had me smiling at the elegant solution as a symbol of the opportunities by the members of the 14th to begin to reconcile to the tragic events that took place in the previous book. Even the epilogue suggests even more deeper layers of the origin of the Alien War.  I'm so glad the final book is available to read, it would have been a long wait...",5,1

A lot of the educational apps aren't fun and engaging, and she gets bored of them quickly. Not this one! She was actually upset when we reached our destination and she had to stop playing. I really believe she learned from it too. I'm definitely going to check out more apps from this company - they seem to know what they're doing! I usually don't like to pay money for apps if there are good free ones out there, but I'll probably end up buying the full version of this one.

Well, apparantly it does in this movie.  And it doesn't stop there.  She continues to add onto the rumors and her infamousness grows.  Its a hilarious movie and I don't want to give to much away, but it is one of those that you kind of forget after a few days, too.  Though you remember upon reviewing or talking about.

YHF finds him seamlessly blending great songwriting with electronic freakout, although sometimes he goes a little over the edge with the found sounds and electronics.  The CD has a lazy, stoned feel to it throughout, which is undoubtedly the condition in which it was created.He's opening for REM on part of their tour, although this music lends itself much better to a club than an arena, because this is very intimate, F'd up music that is best appreciated up close.",4,1

4232295,The Best Graphic Novel Available!,"I was very reluctant to spent $175 on this book but am very happy I did; this is a phenomenal graphic novel.  I am a big Moebuis fan so was tempted to buy this, and then did some research.  It is available in other editions, for instance you could piece it together in various parperbacks or get the French copies.  But that would still be expensive and this is the unedited, uncensored version, from the original art proofs, in its full glory in one beautiful package.  The story is fantastic.  If you are a fan of Blade Runner, The Fifth Element or noir pulp ficticon (like Raymond Chandler) you will like this.  The story is intricate and thoughtful and the art is stunning top quality Moebius.  I highly recommend getting a copy if you can afford it.  Perhaps they will reprint this, but it came out in 2010 so I expect it will not be for at least a couple of more years until the movie (long rumored) is released.  Highest Recommendation!",5,1
1565678,A worthy sequel,"Being the sequel to ""Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman"", this books contains more anecdotes of Richard Feynman's encounters with the world around him.

You could say this was aimed at a fairly small demograghic of older gamers but I think it crosses over into an area that a lot of people would enjoy. Although it was rare for me not to recognize the many many references to gaming and 80's culture, I don't think it would deter anyone younger from enjoying this book. It certain would help to be a gamer of some type, but again, I don't think it would be a deal breaker. The characters and near future plot are believeable and intriguing.

9222965,Elizabeth Montgomery Shines!,"During the 8th season, Bewitched was in the running against shows like ""All in the Family"" and other sitcoms that were more ""up-to-date"".  Bewitched is a refreshing break from those shows when TV sitcoms started dealing with racy issues.  Elizabeth Montgomery shines and Agnes Morehead sparkles! During the 8th season, producers and writers started re-visiting old storylines from previous seasons; but gave them a new twist.  There are  two episodes where Esmerelda conjures up George and Martha Washington.  In these two episodes, George was arrested for inciting a riot.  Aunt Clara in previous years had conjured up Ben Franklin and the George Washington episodes followed the same theme with Ben getting arrested, also.  All in all, it never gets old; Bewitched is a refreshing break from todays sitcoms when you have to send your children out of the room!",5,1

While it is deliberately paced  (read SLOW for some impatient viewers not familiar with Cronenberg's  style)it is nonetheless a worthwhile investment of time and thought.  I  liked it much better than Matrix, and I'm not exactly a Cronenberg fan.  It  should be seen a few times to really take in the complex layering of  realities.

The news of a band defying their record label, releasing the album for free on the internet just for spite, then.... going to another subsidiary of the same label... anyway... at first listen, it was like smoking a Cuban cigar... forbidden in this country. Once the initial joy wore off of listening to this album that defied executives, the real critical ear went to work. The album is dry. The songs tend to run too long and there is a bit too much noise. They can be borderline irritating, and this comes from a listener who tends to like more experimental sounds and artists that have an acquired taste. This album is a must-have simply for the story, but for the music, it's best to stop with &quot;Summer Teeth&quot;.",2,0

2856058,Great start for a new series,"I have to wholeheartedly agree with pretty much all the points V. Nelson (amother reviewer) makes. This book is a great read packed with action and the low price makes it all the more satisfying.I did feel Amber was a little bit coflicted in her personality, sometimes sounding much older while other times much younger than someone with her experiences. The romance comes into play much later in the book going from a trickle to almost immediately a raging waterfall, especially that with Alex. We get so much wonderful action, mystery throughout the book with other great relationships (functional and dysfunctional alike) the romance is not up to par with the rest of the material.Having said all that i think its definitely a great book and page turner ( Yes, I stayed up late reading it too) and I do look forward to reading more about Amber, and once again I second the comment of not making Amber into a sleeze, this story has way more to offer than that.

9017724,Angel,"This is my favorite fantasy/horror TV series possibly ever with only the exception of Supernatural on CW network. Others say Buffy the Vampire Slayer with Sarah Michelle Gellar but they must realize that Angel is an offshoot of Buffy anyway and is equally as good, if not better. If you like Blade you should like Angel. It is almost one and the same thing but Angel adds in slightly more comedy. Do not think their is no violence though. Guns, martial arts, and occult spellcasting galore is an understatement! Cordelia(Charisma Carpenter) is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen! Her sad return and farewell(not giving away TOO much) will make you cry, even if you're a &#34;tough guy&#34;. SHOCK ENDING TO THE SERIES! You will never guess what happens. Excellent special effects, creature makeup/costumes, and backgrounds/sets make this a MUST HAVE for fans of Buffy, Blade, Vampire Diaries,etc. I did not think a TV series could make fantasy/horror this good, but they did.

Problem here is that there are several revisions of Android and multiple hardware Android devices, and author describes peculiarities specific to each.  For example, does a Kindle Fire user have time to read about Honeycomb on DroidX, FroYo on Optimus 3D, or Gingerbread?The colorful Visually series of books show how illustrations can explain.

The plots at a Nation level are completely believable. Brown adds some interesting slants to the historical record. National leaders are added a just the right level and amount. The various institutions-civil or military-are presented and represented at a human level. Lastly, the changing interactions amongst the protagonists could have been an adequate book in itself. Mr. Brown could have taken the easy way out to resolve all the various plots but he did not. That is what makes this book so good..he ended the book the way real life would end..yet I think he left the door for more slightly ajar. This is a rare 5 star from me but the book earned it.

And she most certainly doesn't disappoint with her third book, &#34;A Deadly Justice.&#34; This is a fast-paced thriller. The plot has many twists are turns, so the conclusion is far from  predictable.  The book ties up some lose ends from the previous book. One of the best things about this book is that it had me second guessing who the villain was. If I thought it was one person, the next page or chapter would somehow prove me wrong. I love not knowing right away who the villain is and trying to put the clues together just like the two main detectives in the story, Jade and Maddie.

It revolves around reproductions, art forgery and a missing masterpiece. The fictional story is based on a real event - the largest art heist ever in which 13 works of art from masters as Rembrandt, Vermeer and Degas were stolen from the Gardner Museum in Boston. I loved the main character, Claire. She is a talented but struggling artist, who a few years earlier, was shunned by the art world thru no fault of her own. She has an exceptional abilities and expertise in the art of reproduction and I pulled for her as she struggles to get the recognition she deserves.

The zoom is very noisy however, and the plastic body feels cheap compared to heavier lenses. I find that a 50mm is a little too much zoom for me. I wish I had a 30mm 1.4 or 1.8, but that's on the wish list. This is a great add-on for a K-5 or a K-7 kit lens.

8870036,Simply wow,This film is without a doubt simply one of the greatest Football films ever. I had no idea that racial discrimination between white Americans and African Americans in those days even existed in sports. A great accomplishment by Denzel Washington helped this Movie.

9379684,"Good, clean fun","While the production values on some of the scenes (ones involving cgi or fancy camera work) can be almost laughable sometimes, the rest of this series is quite enjoyable. A set of strong core characters and period setting keep me entertained, even if the mysteries aren't necessarily always top-notch who-done-it's. Throw in guest appearances from historical figures and some cheeky pop references (&#34;the Murdoch identity&#34;) and it's all good fun. This is also a very wholesome show, with some minor references to sex and regular murders, but nothing graphic or explicit is involved. Finally, the main character has a good set of values that he sometimes questions, so he doesn't come across as cartoonishly wholesome and feels &#34;real&#34;.",4,1

But making a wild turn next to the ending of the film, a turn that made clear that all that happened before a lie (or a kind of dream) was inexcusable, absurd, and made me feel like an idiot.

In her books there is always at least one really awesome, hot guy that everybody loves. I consider that fantasy - and fiction, which is why I don't dock for it. I really enjoyed seeing Cy blossom when Web was around and I thought Web went through the journey he needed to go through. I liked the kids and his unapologetic attitude to things.

When and if you can have this kind of friendship, you are truly blessed.  I enjoyed the book especially because it told the stories of the families involved.  I'd say ""read it"" to my friends.

Although the book isn't great, and has no real substance to it, Gwen Cooper's writing makes you not want to put the book down (after page 100 or so!). Her writing keeps you up intil 2 am trying to figure out of her main character Amy reaches social heights or falls flat on her face. The life that her main character lives is what drew me to this book, and in it, if you know the right people, wear the right outfit and get into the part fashionably late and past all of the crowds (with having to pay no cover fee to boot!) then you're instantly ""in"" in South Beach. A good read for those of you who don't take yourself, or life, too seriouslly.",4,1
2141691,One of the best alternate history novels I've read,"This book is, as you probably know if you're reading this review, a history of what might have happened if General Joe Johnston had not been replaced as commander of Confederate forces in Georgia before the fall of Atlanta.  It is well if closely written (if you aren't patient enough to read through details of battles, this book is not for you) and extremely credible, with events and characters better drawn then in the work of such well known alternate history writers as Turtledove and Conroy.  The last pages of the book hint at one or more sequels--I certainly hope so.",5,1

He and the other guys were somehow involved in Danley Dimmel getting hurt.It takes Julian a while to get around to that which happened over Christmas break, but in the meantime, he writes about what happens on the block and at school, all the way through the end of the school year. These include some hijinx that only 12-year-old boys find fun, and those first crushes.I did find it slow-going at first, but I'm so glad I stuck with it.  By the middle of the book, I was charmed by Julian, as well as his big sister, the girls at school Beverly and Jillian, the new man-child from Guatemala Eduardo (LOVED this character!), and the guys from the block and schoolyard.The book is sweet and tender and funny.",4,1

So Sam Spade gets a little tiresome when he never lets down his guard, even when drugged out, mugged or threatened with arrest for murder.On the other hand, this is the classic Hollywood detective movie of the early 40's.  So we expect the cast iron character of the detective caught in a cesspool of intrigue.Lot's of fun with the old stereotypes. Mary Astor as the devious female client, perhaps not as glamorous today as portrayed (&#34;you'll want to see her - she's a knockout&#34;), Sidney Greenstreet as the &#34;fat man&#34; who instigated it all,  and above all Humphrey Bogart as the invincible detective who's going to get to the bottom of this mess.A good classic Hollywood detective movie - if you like that sort of thing.",4,1

I don't eat or drink while watching Rodney because I might laugh that hard. I have seen him live, heard him on the radio and buy his albums. He is the best. ABC really blew it by not promoting this show. THe first episode in which Rodney decides to help out by taking on some duties for the preacher is a side splitter. His great relationship with his friend Barry and his family make this a family friendly show. It is like my family anyway. Rodney's spontaneaous humor is not stifled by this show. Mac Davis as his father in law and the rest of the cast are great. I notice several country stars in supporting roles in the first set and I know there are some in this also. I had been begging for this DVD set since Rodney went off the air. It is well worth it and shows those ABC execs did not know what is good fun.",5,1

I have come to see that Bill Luce's portrait of Dickinson may not be a faithful exhibit of her real personality, but as an introduction to her thoughts it serves a good purpose.

8182038,Must read! First chapter is amazing.,"Wow, the story continues. The first chapter of Brie and Sir's first day at home, as Dom and Sub, is so beautiful. I would have been totally satisfied with just that chapter as the whole book. I had to stop, and regain my sense after just the first chapter. So freaking HOT! However Red Phoenix, just surpasses herself in chapter 2, so romantic, while still utterly erotic. The story is awesome. I almost afraid to say, it is better than Brie's submissive training collection. Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed.",5,1
4933984,Fast & Absorbing,"Disappointed by being passed over on a project, Sabrina goes out after work to drown her sorrows. At the bar, she meets a Brazilian businessman, who's visiting the city to acquire a hotel property. Their liaison begins there and is the start of a satisfying month-long relationship. Things go smoothly, but there are complications in Sabrina's life that she's not willing to talk about until they threaten to spoil her prospects for the future.I enjoyed the banter between Sabrina and Reynaldo at their initial meeting. Ms. Diamond did a great job of conveying his attractiveness and the spark between himself and Sabrina.I like the fact that these characters cut right to the chase and that the writer includes a problematic situation that doesn't seem contrived. This novella left me wanting to read Second Chances, to see how their relationship develops.",5,1
4983796,Decent book with good ideas,Not a bad book. Its very short and it touches on different business ventures to help jump start you in self employment. Does really go into depth of each business idea. Gives you a brief summary with outbound links for more information.,4,1
9426465,I really liked it!,This is a good tender sci-fi movie.  Frank who is losing his memory is given a robot to help him out by his concerned son.  Frank resents the robot at first but then becomes attached to him.  The robot can interact with Frank and it is quite funny in parts.  Definitely worth watching.,5,1
6743210,Good for motorcycle.,Just enough boost to be able to hear at about 65mph in an HJC helmet which isn't wonderfully sealed.  *Some live recordings are hard to hear.

6517216,Best walk around lens by Canon,"After doing much research on various websites and message forums, I've come to the conclusion that the 24-105 L is the perfect walk around by Canon.

6987285,Great managed switch.  Have not had a single problem. Very snappy response when configuring the unit.,"While a tad pricier than consumer switches, I don't think you can buy a better small business switch.  I've had two in place for a couple of months and piped terabytes of traffic through them without a single hiccup.  The response is very good on the configuration web page - I noticed other switches can be a bit laggy, but not this one.  I thought at first I may have bought more switch than I need, but I have been very happy with the quality of these.  I work with Catalyst switches in the office, so I have high expectations for switch performance and configurability.  While this isn't a Catalyst switch, it isn't as expensive as a Catalyst.  While it is a bit more expensive than a retail consumer switch, the quality and performance far exceed a retail units I've used; justifying the cost.  I've had to reset retail units on a regular basis, but these have not required any intervention after setup.",5,1

There is one engineering problem (not with the product itself), but its smaller cover cap doesn't fit tight on the adaptor when both are put together; I found that very inconvenient.",5,1
9056022,Awesome movie,Love this movie.  Females may find it more entertaining that males.  the males i know that have watched though it was hilarious.  Love Jenny McCarthy and the rest of the cast in this movie.  You just never know what that girl will do next.

And he managed to be all of these things nearly simultaneously, all the while chomping on cigars, laughing uproariously, and having the most magnificent time. InTheodore Rex, Morris tells Teddy's story in the perfect tone of voice, and I guarantee you will be engaged - and surprised - at what unfolds.",5,1

486205,"Mediocre attempt that really is not in search of ""Paul""","Crossan and Reed here make a really poor attempt to do several things, provide a historical, sociological, anthropological, and religious context to the world of the historical Paul, while at the same time present a modern travelogue and archaelogical primer of Paul's world. But at the same time, they attempt an exegesis of Paul's writings, give themselves literary license to rewrite scripture, and try to downplay or even declare wrong whole portions of the New Testament.  They obviously started the book with a clear agenda to challenge and find illegitimate non ""politically correct"" portions of the New Testament and so the title is completely misleading.  While obviously everyone is entitled to their own views on scripture, this attempt at religious revisionism is absurd, especially when these authors pretend to do it under the guise of scholarship.",2,0
6043169,You'd be surprised how much of the selections you recall,"I remember about half of the tracks, though most of their titles I did not, just recalling the tunes themselves, but that I recall them from my childhood NOT because my parents had records and played them but as kid growing up during the time periods of the tracks, our radio stations played rock and roll, r&b, soul, country, popular (what would then be adult contemporary), folk and JAZZ such as the tracks offered here - what a wonderful time it was for music.  They sound to be the original hit versions, but cleaned-up and remastered for best audio quality and aural pleasures.  Thank you ACE Records UK for caring so much to put out such a quality product!

7742251,Fabulous Company,I purchased this item in August 2011.  I love to cook and enjoy new gadgets.  This product makes the best roast chicken ever.  My oven's motor stopped working November 2011 and the contact number in the book that came with the item was disconnected.  I Googled Halo Oven and found an operating number. Five days later I had a new motor at shipping cost. The customer service rep was polite and apologized for my inconvenience with the telephone #. She gave me an e-mail address to send a copy of my Amazon invoice and asked I include my telephone #.  She called me an hour later to let me know she received my e-mail and had already shipped my new motor.,5,1
2020262,An Interesting Book to Re-read Years Later,"Had an opportunity to re-read this book recently. I had previously read it when I was in school, many years ago.Obviously, it seems dated now, but at the same time, the story of Stearn's time at the ashram and his experience with how yoga changed his life, is still interesting and compelling.I'm a big fan of yoga and have been for many years. I didn't need any convincing when it comes to believing in what a regular hatha yoga practise can do for a person. It has helped me so much and in so many ways. Re-reading this book, I wondered if Stearn had continued his yoga practise, after returning to real life in New York, after his extended yoga retreat.",4,1

These kits are very well made and all holes lined up perfectly with all needed hardware included and simple, clear instructions/illustrations for assembly.I recommend staining the pieces before assembly- so easy to do. Then put it together and whallah!With a nice, thick mattress the bed is indeed nice and high off the ground- something to consider if it is for small children. More dangerous than an average height bed, should they fall off. I find it perfect for me, however, and the storage space underneath is equivelant to a good size closet, which I greatly appreciate in my small apartment. I have purchased the underbed drawer kit which I look forward to staining and assembling for use under this bed.Highly recommended!",5,1

8458036,Very Informative and Helpful,"Bipolar Disorder is an often misunderstood diagnosis that carries a lot of negative social stigma associated with it. Many people hear the work bipolar and they automatically think &#34;crazy&#34;. People with bipolar are not insane, and is not something to tease or joke around about.What I really liked about this book is that author explains in detail what Bipolar Disorder is, the signs and symptoms and explains how it is diagnosed and treated. It is a great book for friends and family members to read so that they can have a better understanding about what is going on with their loved one.For the bipolar person, this book explains the difference between manic, depressive and hypomania episodes and gives the benefits of different types of treatment and therapy options.I found the book fascinating, just from a psychological level, but it also helped me to understand my best friend better.",5,1

2180561,Thought I Knew How America Was Born,"But I learned otherwise. This book did an excellent job of explaining the reality behind many of our national myths. And showing us the real people behind the myths we've made of the Founding Fathers.The author wrote this to inform the reader of the many highly critical accomplishments of American Patriots prior to 1776, leading to our de-facto nationhood before Independence had even been declared. And this information is critical to understanding how &#34;a rag-tag army of frontiersmen&#34; could take on &#34;the world's greatest army&#34; and win.In fact, the author shows that the Americans, despite having serious equipment shortages, were so much better organized than the British, that in hindsight, American success was not only possible, but perhaps even likely.Have never read better, more informative material on the political, religious, ethnic, financial, and cultural battles being fought between the various groups of Americans, both immigrant and native, culminating with the birth of our nation.",5,1

I really like this mist at night, keeps my mouth from drying out.",5,1
9058881,More gravy than the grave about this movie,"I am not familiar with these types of films, so going in did not know what to expect. The movie sets up a supernatural situation fast, and you think that the boy has gone evil in the afterlife and is out to get the woman who is isolated physically, mentally, and isolated from her husband. Yep, creepy cabin, no one to hear her scream, and some lazy-eyed crazy-cat-woman psychic who talks to the dead warns her of ghosts following her around.But, the movie (for me and other people without an Associate Arts Degree in Film Critiqueing) has some twists and turns that keep you guessing, including some local village people who give off a Hotel California vibe, which all adds up to an intriguing movie with an ending that you probably won't expect. Got to say, I liked it alot and there were a few instances where I was hiding my eyes behind my hand 'cause just knew it was about to get freaky.",4,1

These ReBinder are made from recycled materials and are recyclable themselves, so in a way I'm saving the planet as well as space.ReBinder sleeves are like an elite version of the paper sleeve - sturdier, more protective, and just as easy, if not easier, to file. They're quite snug too and don't allow the disc to shift about. The only downside is you can't see what disc is inside the sleeve because there's no open face. You'll have to write on the cardboard to label it.I also have thetwo-disc ReBinder sleeves, which are just as good and really don't take up much more space than the singles.",4,1

8640121,"Classical tragedy, with stunning music, choreography, and costuming","Although this is a riff on ""Romeo and Juliet"", it's more a classical tragedy- to my mind- than that is.The hallmark of a classical tragedy, I think, is how inevitable the ending-in-tears is. R&J; by that definition, seems more arbitrary, and has at least as much to do with bad teen-aged choices as classic inevitable woe.WSS, though- that's really inevitable, both because of the set-up and how people react to events. For me, that makes it more heartbreaking.I think it is additionally tragic that I can think of a whole number of societies in which this could be set, here and now; I would have hoped that we'd all have become more open-minded and tolerant... but we have not.Highly recommended- both for great music and dance, and also if you want to think.",5,1

I understand his anger - I work with immigrants and see racism all the time, at all levels of society - but answering racism with name-calling may not be the best way to solve the problem.  Never mind, though. The author's is a voice that is seldom heard in this country and he's probably right that he needs to shout in order to get everyone's attention; I wish more Asians would demand to be heard.

However, if you have experienced unfathomable pain, you will find a detailed plan of escape - forgiveness.  This isn't a kumbaya book.  Real tragedy can only be redeemed through the hard restorative work of forgiveness.  The hard work of forgiveness is impossible without an infusion from the Holy Spirit.If you need to forgive someone, you need to read this book.  If your life has been impossible, you will find this book helpful, enlightening, and a good companion for your journey to wholeness.  God created you for a reason.  This book can be the beginning of a new tomorrow.",5,1

Their instrumental and arrangement skills have much improved since Aenima but they also further diluted their music with other artists' influences. ""Disposition"" is reminiscent of Sabbath's ""Planet Caravan"" and ""Reflection"", a reworking of King Crimson's ""The Sheltering Sky"", goes on for much too long and never really takes off. ""Triad"" is superfluous, re-using the main riff of the title track and mixing in parts from several Led Zeppelin tunes (middle-section of ""Whole Lotta Love"", the Indian-like chants of ""Immigrant Song"")",4,1

1296107,Diving book that lacks depth,"I bought this book expecting to read thrilling accounts of the search for this WWII submarine. What I found was an non-stop endless focus on the dangers of diving, some fascinating insight in to what drove these men to undertake such a dangerous adventure and page afer mind-numbing page of boring background details on the key players. Unfortunately,that makes for extremely slow reading, with little sizzle to keep the reader focused on the book. That also led to 356 pages (in my paperback version) that desperately need editing to keep the pace flowing. At times I was left wondering if the author was getting paid by the word.",1,0

The weight of the tripod is much heavier than the aluminum bargain from Wal Mart that I have, but that one let my camera get blown around by ocean breezes too, so the heft of this tripod will be better for long steady shots.  The feet having the ability to change from floor pads to landscape spikes quickly and easy are a nice feature.  The legs pop into the standard tripod position in an instant and with the press of a button they adjust outward which is a feature my bargain tripod did not have.Anyone thinking they could get the same quality for a better deal at a big-box store has not shopped for them there or doesn't care about the very nice features of this tripod.",5,1

It's an IKEA kitchen with limited space. And we are not there all the time so I just needed one good set of something to do cooking or baking. This was a good choice. I read a lot of bad reviews on previous models (7 piece/ 8 piece) so I waited till this one became available.The sieve that was in the previous model was plastic and flimsy. This one is make of metal mesh so it's a lot sturdier.The skid-proof on the bottom of the bowl was good, too.When we made pancake breakfast, it worked out perfectly.I don't think it's for rough usage.I love it when I can click everything into one tidy package.",5,1

This is the second I've owned since the first one I had was robbed by some foul roommates, so I guess that says alot right there that I would purchase another one to replace the first that was stolen.It has all the work horse qualities that made the D610 a favorite in my house with updated hardware and software that removed most of the drawbacks of it's predecessors.

In my small hometown, I already know quite a few people who delight in quoting the show - I am no exception! The story revolves around the dysfunctional (but endearingly relatable) Bluth family. Michael, the only halfway stable and decent family member resigns himself to holding together the family after the untimely incarceration of George Bluth, Sr. Jason Bateman portrays Michael's deer in headlights panic perfectly. Gob is my favorite character. He is hands-down the most pathetic of all the family members, and his chicken impression always leaves me in stitches. I would advise that you watch this with no distractions :the rapid-fire jokes in this show are also visual! I think that is why the show did not capture the ratings it needed to return for more seasons - you have to be quick to enjoy this one.",5,1

926670,Another funny bok from Carl Hiaasen,"Star Island involves the escapades of a Britney/Lindsey type ""singer"" named Cherry Pie, who, through the magic of studio computers, takes a mediocre voice and makes it sound great.  She and the sycophants who surround her, think she is wonderful, but the dream may be coming to an end as Cherry Pie cannot seem to stay sober and has a big tour coming up that is make or break.To that end, a look-a-like named Ann is hired to show up at events Cherry can't, stay long enough to have her photo taken, and then go back behind the shadows.  Ann gets involved with our old riend Stink, who wants to save her from a photographer who has discovered her true identity.As usual with Hiaasen, several color characters are involved in her manager's attempts to keep her sober long enough to make it to the shows.  One of my favorites employs a cattle prod everytime she says ""like"" in a sentence, which is. like. every other word.  Not great literature, but definitely a fun, enjoyable read.",4,1
860300,The personality you project,"Set aside your personal political affiliation and views.  I think more people would like the book if it revolved around some other terrorist act in another part of the world (rather than 9/11), some other conflict than this one that is so fresh on our minds.The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a good story.  If you focus on the relationships the main character has, the delivery style, and the substory that is happening in the ""now"", you will enjoy it.  Hamid presents an interesting study on human behavior/sensibility and the pulls of nationalism and its duties.  At one level, the characters act all the same, but for each their personal histories bubble to the surface and take their lives in wildly different directions.  As others have said, the main character isn't so much reluctant as he is surprised by his own feelings.",5,1

The characters are well-portrayed and extremely lovable.  Pollyweena's Aunt and teacher are the typical anathema to the girls' otherwise joyful lives.  A great read and a fun book.  No doubt it will hold the attention of even the most defiant of first readers.  Kudos to you, Patricia, for taking me back into the misunderstood days of my youth!",5,1
7145105,Excellent fast drives,"These drives are fast and relatively inexpensive.  I have three of these drives internal to my main desktop system and one inside my wife's desktop system.  In addition, we use two of them externally for backups (you'll need to find an appropriate case and power supply, mine is a kludge made from an old PC).  Or, you can get a &#34;Seagate Backup Plus&#34; which solves the external case problem for you.The drives have been very reliable.  I have experienced one drive failure in three years, and that one shipped with my desktop.  It failed within a month of being placed in service.  I attribute the failure to possible rough handling during shipping of the system unit.  None of the replacement drives that I've purchased individually have failed, they all came well packaged in sturdy boxes with lots of packing.Do be sure to get the 6Gb/s SATA cables for this drive.  If you use the slower cables, you may have performance problems and/or data errors.",4,1
674877,Creepy to the max,This book a-mazing. There is no doubt that Joe Hill has earned his own voice in this genre. This was one of the spookiest books I've ever read...along side some of his father's books. I could not put it down and dreamt of the Christmasland kids in my sleep.

6580764,Great product,"I've only used this for 2 days, so I can't review on long-term use.  I thought the retractable cable would have a button to make the ends go in, but it doesn't. You have to pull on it and let go quickly to make it retract. I can see how it would break easily for this reason. I just plug mine into my Opod touch and leave it on the passenger's seat, so it doesn't get much abuse. The sound is CRYSTAL clear (better than my XM radio and CD's). All in all, you really can't beat it for the price.",4,1

3147015,Guide for brief stays or drive through,"This guide is ideally suited to those on driving vacations or brief stay near one of the many national parks in the western states.Each chapter is broken into sections: introduction to the park, when to visit, how to get there, park essentials, scenic drives, what to see, sports and outdoors, what's nearby, nearby attractions, where to eat and where to stay. Each chapter has color pictures and a map of the park with highlights and highways/roads. Chapter sizes range from a few pages to many depending upon the size/features of the park in question.I found the information for the parks I have visited to be reasonably accurate with my memories. I was a little disappointed in the number of pictures based upon experiences with other travel guides, but I can see using this guide while traveling near a park and wanting to make a short excursion (I'll take my own pictures &lt;g>). Those planning on extended visits to a park would be better advised to pick up a dedicated guide to the individual park. P-)",4,1

The world-building is truly innovative.  The story ends nicely (no cliffhangers, but plenty of room for further exploration in this world).Criticisms:  Some deus-ex-machina in the plot, but plausible.  The villains are somewhat card-boardyI'm very much looking forward to seeing more by this author!",5,1

Gideon spent two years as a captive of the Taliban while serving in Special Ops.  He feels like he is so damaged that he can never make a commitment to a woman.  Chemistry sparks and these two are set ablaze while Gideon remains determined to be emotionally uncommitted until a catalyst for change arrives in Fool's Gold.

That other-worldliness.  That life-is-beautiful-and-surprising character of Chagall's art.  Her illustrations are exactly right for this book.The text is good -- especially if you are looking to relate this book to a child who seems to try a lot of things without finding something that ""clicks"" for them.

7528721,Tong Perfection...,"We have owned these tongs for a while now and I cannot find anything to complain about!  The handle(s) are very sturdy - allowing you to really get a good squeeze on something if it is heavy or slippery.  The stainless steel always emerges from the dishwasher spotlessly clean and the ""locking"" mechanism allows these to be stored in the folded position, saving me a lot of cluttered drawer headaches!Seriously, these would be good tongs at any price and at this price they are well worth the money spent.",5,1

This book is simply amazing. I absolutely loved the story and I fell in love with the characters. I was still shocked with a certain death towards the beginning but it made way for a beautiful story, I forgive you for doing that Kate - this was the first book to ever make me cry while reading.I highly recommend reading this book and make sure the tissues are nearby.",5,1
1637642,Taking the 'Sin' Out of Cinnamon Rolls,"With three children in Iraq during the first Gulf War and weighing 300 pounds, Joanna Lund found herself thinking about death. After losing 130 pounds, Healthy Exchanges was born, and this cookbook is the latest in her series.Although a discussion about Splenda's safety would have been helpful, recipes like Decadent Fudgy Brownie Pie, Classic Cherry Cobbler, Cappuccino Cheesecake and even Choca-Cola Cake are sure to delight dieters. Not every recipe works, but many do.  So can we finally take the ""sin"" out of cinnamon rolls?  This book says yes - and I tend to agree.",4,1
7376343,Best Ipod,"My husband loves his Ipod Touch. he takes it everywhere and uses it daily. very light and convenient and would suggest a case from Otterbox or Griffin to keep it in pristine condition.

After I get my model A Pi set up the way I want, I switch to wireless and battery power and add it to my wireless sensor grid. I've got three Plugable powered USB hubs also. Consistent high quality throughout. I have no experience with customer service since I've never needed it, but if I ever do, I expect it it will be as good as their products. Very happy customer..",5,1

7798675,No mo muffin pans!,"I really enjoyed making muffins using these baking cups, especially cause I didn't have to use my gross muffin pans.  (In fact, I have thrown them out. They were impossible to keep clean.) My corn and banana nut muffins don't stick to these cups at all, which is so nice. No more wasted muffin bottoms or paper to throw out. I was worried that the muffins would taste or smell like silicone, but they don't at all.  And I swear they cooked a bit faster and more evenly.I just threw them in to soak in some dishwater, swooshed them around a bit, rinsed, and dried. I'm ready to make another batch of something.

1094631,Disappointing,"What started as a great premise deteriorated into an implausible mystery. I was really hooked during the first part of the book. It focused on how the media and the legal system conspire to put people doing the right thing at risk for lawsuits and how there are no accidents in the courtroom. Somebody always has to pay and the deeper the pockets the better.Having been a fan of Ms. Scottoline, I was looking forward to a trial, but it was not to be.

6816788,Ingenious Idea,"To get the one slight negative out of the way, yes, it is a little expensive.  However, when you consider the relatively small market for this product, it's reasonable to reward the designers for their effort.  With that little nit out of the way, this thing just works.  It's well designed, well made, and sits unobtrusively out of the way holding, in my case, my Time Machine drive.  I haven't noticed any scratches, but I'm not worried about them, either.",5,1

7455738,Finally- the perfect screen protector,"I've been using screen protectors on my phones since I got my first smart phone (Nexus S), and this is the best I've ever used.In terms of the protector itself, it's exactly what you'd expect. It fits the screen (and sensors on the top-portion of the screen) perfectly, and it feels great to touch (it's not sticky or anything).The genius of this product is in the applicator.The protector comes sandwiched between two protector-protectors. This makes applying the protector cleaner, in the sense that it's basically impossible for stray hairs/dust/whatever to get onto your screen before you can apply the product. I've wasted many protectors in the past by applying them and then realizing a piece of dust got caught underneath, because once you lift it back up, it's impossible to clean and reapply.Bottom line is if you're looking for a screen protector for your S4, this is what you want. It's a great product, and it comes with 3 protectors, making this an unbeatable value.",5,1

It looks exactly like what you see in the teapot picture. It is very exciting to see the tea opens up. The smell and the flavor of the tea are also great! As for the teapot, on the other hand, I was glad that I got it for free since it probably worth just that much. It feels cheaply made. As other reviewers have said, it does not hold the heat of the water much. I saw a similar teapot at a local discount store for $5.99. That would be a fair price for this pot.",4,1

8965819,perhaps the best sci-fi show ever produced,"Leave it to studio executives to screw up the best thing to hit sci-fi in decades.Firefly is a fantastic story-oriented, character driven sci-fi western - YES, sci-fi western.  Sounds odd, and the pilot is a bit slow to get going, but once you hit episode 3 it's your new addiction.  When my wife and I got through the last episode, we were really sad that there weren't any more to watch.We did watch the 'Serenity' movie, which was a good follow-up.I strongly, fully, totally, absolutely, whole-heartedly recommend  this show.",5,1

I am overall very disappointed and it will make me think twice about buying from Amazon.",1,0
936536,Interesting at times,"I purchased this book for my niece, but decided to read it before I gave it to her. The story is about a 17-year-old girl named Bella, who falls madly in love with a vampire named Edward.Overall, I wish the story would have been more developed.  I think it focuses too much on the sexual attraction between Bella and Edward, and is  a bit outrageous with the lengths Bella will go to because of her love for him.  I gave it two stars, because at times it is an interesting read.  I've decided to hold on to this book until my niece is a bit older.  I think the sexual overtones in this relationship is for an older teen.  I found their relationship to be a bit dysfunctional.  I thought Edward was condescending and almost on the verge of being emotionally abusive.  The author never relates that Bella's blind devotion may come from the supernatural powers a vampire may have over a human.  The reader is led to believe that Bella's crazy behavior is because of true love.  I did not like that message.",2,0

1131039,Yuck,"This is possibly one of the worst books I've ever read.  It's a cheap knock off of the Twilight style or writing that's become so popular lately, but unlike Stephanie Meyer's books it falls sadly flat.  The writing is inconsistent and in places almost seems forced.  The main character spends too much time debating her humanity (or lack thereof).  One paragraph tells the reader that she did X because of her human side and a handful of pages later saying she doesn't have a human side so she doesn't understand Y.I wasn't able to finish the whole book.  I'm sorry I spent as much time on it as I did.  I think I tend to be a bit harsh on these reviews, but this one gets a definite Blech! =P~~ from me.",1,0

But the brother that at first reminded me of the ""Pillsbury Dough Boy"" really caught me looking the wrong direction.Dean Koontz is often described as anti big, corrupt, secretive. etc. government and in this story, that side of him comes alive in spades!

I say almost because you need you attach a sort of plug into the lock cable socket, which makes it really easy to attach the lock cable to the laptop, but it means that you can't take advantage of the other lock cable to lock another notebook... The convenience factor of leaving the bulky lock cable on you normal workplace and taking the smaller one home or to meetings is really good (which is essentially the purpose of the product).",4,1

8821114,"Very Good, But...","What's to complain about?  This DVD has just about everything: excellent picture quality, sound, and state-of-the art effects work.  The special feature disc is loaded with documentary material and deleted scenes.  Nevertheless, some of the acting is pretty bad (Jake Lloyd in particular), and the dialog is lame in spots.  Certainly these were gripes I had about the theatrical version, and I still went to see it twice!  The extra footage added to the DVD version does make it noticeably better.  I just hope George and the gang make an effort to rein in the more maudlin elements in Episode 2.In my mind, the best &quot;Star Wars&quot; episode overall is &quot;The Empire Strikes Back (aka Episode V)&quot;, displaying excellent acting, visuals, and plot.  The cornball stuff took a back seat; it would be great to see at least one of the first three episodes come close to it.",4,1
4964687,A Haunting Love Story,"Immortal Love is a haunting love story, as one would expect of a tale involving two of romantic Spain's most romantic poets,Becquer and Lorca, but it is more than that. It is a story of  the struggle between the different, conflicting aspects of love, including love's dark sisters, hate and jealousy, and what happens when they collide. For someone with only a passing familiarity with Spanish literature, it was a fascinating read and prompted me to want to learn more.",5,1
1273112,Amazing,"This is the second carl sagan book I have read(the first being cosmos). Now this book is definately not as good as cosmos, it is still worth 5 stars. It covers a much more specific subject matter than cosmos and is still very enjoyable.This book will give you those classic carl sagan moments were you set the book down, look up and just think 'wow'.

8630309,A Solid Eastwood Vehicle,"Though it gets lost in the ""Dirty Harry"" shuffle, ""The Gauntlet"" (1977) is an underrated action drama with more emphasis on characterization than bullets. In a change-of-pace role, Clint Eastwood plays a down-and-out Phoenix cop who faces seemingly impossible odds - and endless corruption - when he is assigned to escort a Las Vegas prostitute (Sondra Locke) to trial. Needless to say, Clint's slimy boss (William Prince) wants to make sure he doesn't get the job done. Stylishly directed by Eastwood, the film moves at a fast clip and benefits from strong performances. Interestingly, Eastwood's character fires his gun only twice and never kills anyone. The elaborate climax is a bit ludicrous (why don't the Phoenix officers shoot out the bus tires?), yet ""The Gauntlet"" remains on-target most of the way. A must-see for Eastwood fans.",4,1

2917181,Liked but with reservations-,"If you like past Roman history with a bit of intrigue and sex thrown in you will like this book.Frm the very begining the reader is taken into a world of subterfuge, twisting plots and misplacedalliances.  I did like Theodosia for most of the book even when she was trifling with all heradmirers and using some of them very  badly.  There were just some lapses that bothered meto the point where it ruined the story namely-How is Theodosia was able to survive the horrid Roman prison for so many years with literallya broken body when other 'hale and hearty' men did not?At the end when Otho is chasing her in the rain and dark she gets away; what happens to him?He is left cursing and riding in the rain.Some of the 'solutions'  to her many problems seemed a bit too easy and the ending well itwas an ending.",4,1

If you read the other books, of course you're going to see some of the same things mentioned from other books because the lives of the brothers overlap, therefore the story lines overlap..... but... I must say... SABLE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. HOT HOT HOT... Once I start reading something I pick up from Ms. Hunter, I just can't put it down, and to be honest, I will read it again and again.

Gut-wrenching laughter, not a tee-hee.  Laughter that brought tears to my eyes.  Having said that, I cannot believe there are a couple of negative reviews.  My first response is ""are they living on this planet"" - who could lack such a sense of humor, empathy and love for this dog after reading this book.  The author was brilliant in his descriptions of Marley's subnormal condition (as Evelyn Woodhouse may have described him).  For the negative reviewers, I have this comment for you: if this book doesn't warm the cockles of your heart, nothing will.",5,1

In truth it is basically a story of survival and commiment to others and what is learned along the path when your world or the world you know is taken away from you.A terrific thriller than doesn't rely on special effects but on the directions of its creators and the acting of its cast.",5,1
6243795,It didn't work.,"I got these for my mom so she would stop stealing mine. They were different than mine, though, because they are significantly tighter around the foot.

3002603,Surprised me and learned a lot,"I picked How to Trade because it looked a little smaller and more manageable than a lot of books I've seen that look like they would make great doorstops. I'm a new trader and I wanted to get a feel for what trading is all about. By page 26 I learned more than I ever expected about how and why we are lied to all the time in the media by the experts, which I always suspected but never could exactly figure out. The whole last part of the book had myth after myth debunked about trading, the markets, and investing. This is stuff I've been hearing my whole life, and guess what---most of it is dead wrong. This explains why so many people lose on such a consistent basis. There were a few annoying typos here and there, like EFT instead of ETF, and I wish the book was a little longer and got into more specifics and tools, but overall, quite a lot of info, very condensed and very good, by someone who at least comes off like a real trader who has been there.

2029913,The Mark of RAN... a great beginning!,"An enticing fantasy/adventure by Paul Kearney.When I started to read this book I had some initial concerns that it may have been meant for an adolescent audience; such is not the case. Although the story seems to begin rather tamely, the main character (Rol) quickly becomes engrossed in a story of travel, intrigue and combat; then add to this some sexual innuendos, betrayals and a liberal dose of magic, and you have just about everything anyone could want in a good adult fantasy novel.The quality of writing is good, however it is the story line, with its many twists and surprises, that really make this book hard to put down.All in all, a excellent start to (hopefully) a ongoing series of entertaining novels. The second book is coming out soon and I'm looking forward to being able to continue to follow the story of Rol. 5 Stars.",5,1

5888990,Current Favorite,"Even though I've listened to this since it came out, I never tire of it.  The Piano Concerto is truly a wonderful work, both ""masterpiece"" and joke, and why not?  Well, maybe not a joke; though, if you listen carefully, you're bound to chuckle at some point.  Beethoven, the classical composer Ligeti reminds me most of, had a sense of humor combined with a taste for complexity also.In fact, I feel as though I am hearing quotations of Beethoven in the cadenza right near the end of the Concerto, but I just can't place them.The rest of the disc is just as good.  These pieces have all been recorded before; even though ""Mysteries of the Macabre"" is a orchestral premiere, I've got a Roland Pontinen/Hakan Hardenberger version for piano/trumpet I might prefer.  But the other performances are the best I've ever heard of these works.  Well-recorded too.",5,1

2597631,"Cute, but lacked a little pazzazz!","The story is about Scarlett, as she opens her bakery, deals with crazy family members, her best friend's wedding and her on-going struggle with self esteem.  Add in some romantic tension as two men vie for Scarlett's attention:  the hunky bad boy or the geeky dependable friend.My take:  great plot, loved the characters, loved Scarlett, well written...  However, the book lacked that spark; there were no re-read parts (the parts that were so good you just have to go back and read them again!).  This is a cute sequel to the first book in this series but wasn't as exciting ad the first.  I would recommend reading it if you've been following this series.  If you haven't read the series, it will be terribly boring to pick it up here!",4,1
8777576,"Nobody watches these for the art, anyway","I assume nobody has ever watched this expecting Oscar material.  So what if it's mostly a gila monster crawling through an HO-scale train set?  Can't we just have some good, cheesy, fun once in awhile?That kid was a pretty good singer, too.  Too bad nothing came of him.",4,1
4883716,Great book.,"This might be a ""kid's book"", but like ""Mystery of the Egyptian Scroll, Secret Agent Zet"", I recommend this to anyone, of any age. You find yourself on the edge of your seat hoping Ramses prevails. His gift has been deemed unholy by the priests. Only his father, mother, and the farm manager believe in him and his gift. His journey is long, filled with challenges and danger.There's enough history, details of Egyptian life, adventure and mystery to satisfy any reader. It could have been longer, but was complete as it was. I just hope there might be another book in the works.",5,1

6699233,"So far, most excellent","Drive installed instantly and simply on Vista Home Premium, has been running for a couple weeks with zero glitches. Slightly smaller, noticeably quieter and cooler than the IO 750gb drive it sits next to. Nice looking case. Read/write light is on the side if you have the drive in the vertical stand.EMC Retrospect software's user interface is a little thick, but once you get the hang of it, it's very good, functional backup ware. I've used it for a year to do daily and weekly backups to multiple drives and it works fine.Good product; good deal. I might buy another one.",5,1

782050,I loved this book!,"I absolutely loved this book. Taking place in the South at the very beginning of the civil rights era, it really evokes the time and place. Even though I don't share a background with any of the characters, I really cared about and empathized with the people in this book. I was so anxious to find out what happened that I stayed up too late three nights in a row to finish the story. And, I was so sad when I came to the end of the book because I wanted to read more about the brave, quirky and warm Southern women in the story.",5,1
6475625,Not  Acceptable for Multi-user or WEP Access,"I hoping to use the WGR101 to provide wireless, encrypted access to two laptops from a wired ethernet connection in a hotel. It worked fine in single-user, no encryption mode but that is not what I needed. I experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with WEP or in multi-user mode with and without WEP. One or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection, sometimes I had to reboot the laptops, sometimes I had to reboot the WGR101, and sometimes I had to reboot the laptops and the WGR101. Stay away from this product unless single user, unencrypted access is what you need.",1,0
4425893,Outstanding,"A phenomenal book.  DOnt know why it is not more common, should be sold at newstands.It goes through the philosophical and legal origins of the 2nd Amendment in a format that meets legal rigor without being as dense and unreadable as most legal texts.If you are pro-gun and dont know why this is where to get a real foundation for your belief in self-defence and the right to keep and bear arms.Awesome ammo to use on anti-gun types.",5,1
2871407,EVERY BOOKSHELF MUST HAVE A COPY !,"I have just recently began to appreciate poetry.I am a college student at Florida A&amp;M University and there are plenty of talented poets who publish poetry of love in our school newspaper. So when Mr.Tyler's book was  introduced to me, it was a must that I purchase it. The words, the passion  behind those words left me breathless and often times speechless. It was  hard to decide on a favorite but I did it. Did You Like? I recited it to a  friend on Valentine's Day and well, let's just say I think I'm in there!  The appearance of the book is impressive in itself. The satin bookmark, the  elegant calling card, the rose petals ! OH MY GOD...maybe that was a  secret. oopps! I wish I had space to share all of my feelings about this  book but I don't. I can only make a suggestion, BUY THE BOOK !",5,1
583045,Great Book,"If you love art, you will want to read about the greatest heist of the century.  The crime remains unsolved, so you will not have closure, but you will find this book interesting.  There is a mystery, history about the museum itself and altogether a good time will be had by all.",4,1

The time setting is just far enough in the past to activate your imagination and hold your interest since it is not the common time frame we are accustomed to seeing on tv or the current movies...attention holding and filled with anticipation. Marvelous entertainment.",5,1

1345009,One Star is One Too Many,"I've thought long and hard about all the horrible things I wanted to say about this book, but I've decided that I wasted enough of my life reading the wretched thing to warrant any more time and effort.  If you look at any of the other reviews that go into great detail about all of the reasons this book is nothing but awful, then you'll know how I feel and why I gave it one star.  I would have given it less, if Amazon allowed me, like maybe one point on one star, but alas, one was the worst I could give it.  Read it if you must, but remember, you were warned.",1,0
2124676,I couldn't put it down,"I thoroughly enjoyed the well developed characters as well as the consistent and interesting story. There were no parts bogged down with mundane detail, making this a true page-turner in anticipation of what would befall the characters next.",5,1
607919,I love Vlad and Leila!,"I am an avid reader, usually go through a book a day, and it is rare to find a book I enjoy enough to re-read.  However, to date, I've read this one at least four times.  I love it and cannot wait for the next installment.  The characters work together brilliantly, captivating the reader from the start.  I love Vlad as the romantic hero and the dynamic between himself and the heroine is nearly perfect.  Somehow, Frost makes Vlad's nonchalant arrogance appealing.  However, I predict he gets some sort of comeuppance in next book.  This is my favorite book in the whole Cat and Bones series and break out series - and I've read them all.",5,1
5594342,Worth your time,"I won a copy and promised a review in exchange. This is the first book I have read by this author, but it won't be the last. I wished this had been a little longer because it felt a little rushed. Aside from that it was a great read. I loved the h and her smarta** attitude. It kept me captivated from the start and at no time was I bored by it. I finished it in one setting and was surprised by who the bad guy ended up as. There was even a point where one of the Hero's let me down and I was cussing at my Kindle. I think you will enjoy it!",5,1
7972329,AWESOME!!,If you thought Dane was a page turner you NEED to read Thomas!!  Liliana Hart out did herself with this one. This is a MUST read!  I can not wait to move forward to the next two brothers!,5,1
8657271,Better than the first two!,"I've liked all the Mission Impossible movies, but to me this one was the best.  This is primarily due to the great villain played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  He was perfecly cast and delivers great dialogue.  His final fight with Cruise was thrilling and even brought a standing ovation from some in the audience.  The editing and pacing of the film was also perfect-I never felt bored or overloaded with action.  Cruise was good as usual and if you can overlook his kookiness you will enjoy this movie.",4,1

For those who believe that bands like Weather Report were the direct ancestor of what is known as &quot;smooth jazz&quot; and/or the downfall of civilization as we know it...  For self-proclaimed &quot;purists.&quot;  This album might change your perspective a bit.  McLaughlin and his crew are heroes, and are not written, but burned, into the great book of jazz in the heavens.",5,1
5711970,This album just never gets old!,"I'll reiterate what every music critic has mentioned: the sound on this recording is stellar, the vocal harmonies between the three leads are extraordinary, the songwriting is outstanding, etc.  What makes me spin this CD more often than most is the fact that the lyrics are also incredibly personal and touch on subject matter that is universal and emotionally resonant.  There are the obvious hits which include ""Dreams,"" ""Don't Stop,"" and ""Go Your Own Way.""  Then there are other songs here that reach epic standards like ""The Chain"" and ""Gold Dust Woman.""  To top it all off there are some fun tracks like ""Second Hand News"" and ""I Don't Want To Know.""  This album has achieved iconic status representing some of the finest music ever to come out of the seventies.  Be that as it is, the music still sounds fresh and vibrant today as when it was first released.  Front to back, this is an essential album for any collection.  Highly recommended.",5,1
1854898,Awsome,This book is not really a romance but more of a suspense. I read all the Black Dagger Brotherhood series and decided to try this series and I am glad that I did. I am very pleased.,5,1

5452386,Great Book!,"A new very unique perspective on the theme of human woman meets alien lover/mate. Chosen after passing all the exhaustive tests of the Intergalactic Matchmaking Services, Maggie refuses to even visit the Alien spaceship without her beloved pet Siamese cat. She is a very responsible pet owner and loves Mamszell too deeply to turn her over to a another as a convenience. This is a light hearted (somewhat short) story of love developing between a human girl and a Alien man (Daxon) who wanted no part in the experience of match making.Maggie is on the run after witnessing a murder by the leader of a gang. Her attempt to leave town for a few weeks turns into instant, almost love at first sight with Security Chief Daxon. This is a sweet (not full of erotic sexual scenes) story every pet owner or not should love to read. The scenes between the Aliens meeting a demanding Siamese cat are genuinely hilarious! Don't miss this wonderful book.",5,1

The best thing this book reminded me of is that if I am happy then those around me are too!  I am going to recommend this book to all my friends!

2651011,gripping,"I am trying to read all of the september 11 books.  I am not exactly sure why; maybe just to be reminded not to become complacent about it.  This one juxtaposes chapters describing the plot with chapters focused on the bios of individual victims, a technique that, I think, makes the tragedy more vivid than massing victims in to a big number.  I learned a few new things about the plot, a lot of new things about some of the heroism of the victims and the minutes before the collapse.  In contrast to the previous reviewer, I did not think the approach was clinical; if anything, I thought the writing was a big overwrought in places.  Still, this is a minor complaint about a really well done book.",5,1

That is, until it goes bonkers at the end ... a nice manipulation technique by the director. Eihi Shiina's range of performance from ideal femininity to psycho-killer is fabulous and accounts for a sizable chunk of the shock we experience at the end of the film. You'll watch the wire part because this woman is so beautiful and the pleasure she takes in her work so adorable.",4,1

2557143,CREEPY JOURNEY,"Nicholson captures small town life in an unsettling fashion in this tale of evil centered on a red church and the mysterious ""pastor"" who comes to start a new religion.  The plot has been described in various details, so I'll spare you any additional narratives.Suffice to say, there are several frightening scenes, some unusual plot twists, and an always impending sense of doom.  The book sometimes falters in key spots where the tension is slackened by a little too much padding.  But, overall, the dialogue and scenarios are well written and chilling.RECOMMENDED.",4,1

I also like that, so far, I haven't come across any hidden ways to try &amp; get me to spend any more real money!

1908544,The world needs more &quot;Dartmouth Reviews&quot;,"In its stated purpose of &quot;mentoring&quot; college-aged, or younger, conservatives, this book does a fine job in introducing its target audience to many of the distinctive elements of traditional conservative thought. It's not a perfect book, and maybe someday I'll write a column somewhere about how D'Souza fundamentally mis-states the libertarian philosophy, and libertarian beliefs on some key issues. In that section, at least, he does his young friend &quot;Chris&quot; a real disservice. It's only because that's such a relatively small part of the book that I'm not downgrading my ranking more.But apart from that (and the author's annoying idolatry -- it's not too strong a word -- of Lincoln), there is much here to learn from and enjoy. If campus conservatives can arm themselves with the information -- and also the techniques -- D'Souza passes along here, the political atmosphere of our colleges will be much improved, and much more entertaining.",4,1

703264,Spiritual practice in the real world.,"Here is a book worth reading and re-reading from time to time. The Invitation is the antithesis of the all-too-common, overly simplified self-help books that teach in cliches and promise more than they can possibly deliver. Don't be fooled by her name --- Oriah is a real person living in the real world, with a goal of being the best person she can be. And this book is an honest, intimate sharing of her efforts --- triumphs and failings included.I find it interesting that the negative reviews of The Invitation are written with what seems to me to be so much anger, fear and even hatred. These reviewers frequently site their fears of Oriah's misguided values, but they have no problem investing their energy into going beyond reviewing a book to personally attacking a person they have never met.",5,1

Unfortunately other units like this one I've owned gave up the ghost far too early.Why did I get another after having problems with them in the past? There are three reasons. First off I got a heck of a sale on my new one plus free shipping. Secondly and I guess most importantly is the fact that when these units do work they work very,very,well. Had they not worked well no sale would ever tempt me to buy another. THIRDLY I have allergies to dust and mold. The HEPA filter works very well on this vac and does even better if you use the special allergen filtration bags.To tell the truth the reason the other vacs did not last for me is the fact that my son treats them like super heavy duty, 4 wheel drive, all terrain, goes over any obstacle vacuum cleaners.Will my new one last??

1999093,Shapiro's best.,"Let me say before I begin my review of this particular collection, Alan Shapiro is one of my favorite poets.  His collections are always wonderfully cohesive... not ALWAYS themed, but there seems to be a nice thread running through each one.  This one is the grittiest, most real (to me), and I think it contains so many wonderful poems which would be accessible even to those who might find poetry obscure or intimidating.  This book becomes my new Shapiro favorite, right behind the wonderful previous release ""Old War: Poems.""  Love this book.  FIVE hearty stars.",5,1

She thoroughly researches her material and writes in such a way as to keep the reader on the end of his/her seat. It is easy to see why her books are rated so highly. I hope she just keeps writing them because I will haunt the list to read every one sent to print. To anyone looking for a better-than-good read, GET THIS BOOK!",5,1
8156674,Heartaches are sometimes good.,"This story hit a nerve for me. My dad was an alcoholic and so the journey Jimmy had to go on made me realize how hard it must have been for my dad. Anyway, I liked that Eddie wanted to fix Jimmy and at first felt he went about it the wrong way. However, as the story progressed, I could see the love Eddie had for Jimmy, even with the 'intermix' of Dan. I did not care for Dan at first. He was too pushy and was still pushy even though he knew that Eddie was in love with Jimmy. Good back story on both men. You could see Jimmy's growth and understanding of himself and his issues. I loved this story and the fact that the men had their HEA.  Dan needs his own story and it does not need to include Eddie and Jimmy.",5,1
3325269,Homicide Detective's Method Of Proving Christianity,"J. Warner Wallace does an outstanding job of using his skills as a L.A. homicide detective (who has solved many cold cases) to look at the case for Christianity.  By examining numerous eye witness accounts of the events, he looks for inconsistencies in their stories to disprove the truth of Christianity only to find that all the accounts are amazingly consistent and he can't crack the case.  It must be true.The first section of the book teaches you how to be a detective and applies those principles to the case for Christianity.  The second section helps you examine the evidence using a series of questions that good detectives use.  The third section is the appendix and gives credit to the expert witnesses that were used, the assisting officers and the case notes and supporting evidence.All in all, a fun and fresh way to examine the case for Christianity in a relevant way for today.",5,1
3620644,Amazing Truth,"Even though this book is fiction the truth was told on so many topics, especially loving a Black Queen.

4816272,Team Lucas,"I usually don't write reviews as although I love to read I am not a very good wordsmith but LIF is worth the effort.Ms Hanson brings us into the paranormal world lead by the sizzling hot Lucas, who's goal is to bag our heroin Val, weather it is for love or for.... other purposes. Val is torn between her attraction to Lucas and her ties to Jack, our favourite Vampire hunter, and that is only the tip of the iceberg.

2476109,Very handy,"You are going to find this a handy book.  We all enjoy being able to put together great tasting recipes in a jiffy.  You will be able to do that with this.  My favorite part of this book is that many of our Bisquick favorites are no longer on the back of cards, boxes, but right there ready to go.  This book has a wide variety of recipes, definately more than I thought possible for Bisquick.  You are going to find this book helpful when your in search of something quick to put together for dinner.",5,1

2367321,The Southwestern Homesteaders,"A friend handed me this book when I told her that my grandmother raised my mom and her six siblings in the Panhandle of Texas, widowed, facing the depression years and, even worse, the Dust Bowl.  So I found the setting amazingly true, and the story of Lilly a heroic description of one woman's thriving through flood, storm, 500-mile horse rides, teaching, being displaced, betrayed and alone in Chicago, searching for work, time and again.  The narrative is so brilliantly detailed that I can imagine being there, walking through Santa Fe, running a ranch, living on a mesa!  Thank you for this story, Jeannette Walls, for sharing this memory of your grandmother.",5,1

4706603,So many parallels,"Having recently lost my mother, I found this book comforting.  My brothers and I went thru many similar circumstances with the cleaning out, selling and disposing of the treasured items accumulated in her home of 56 years.  The decisions not to want things that meant so much to another is a difficult process. Redistributing or disposing of drawers of pictures, school projects and newspaper clippings becomes a daunting task, not to mention the knick/knacks, clothes, etc.  The author approached this with clarity, dignity and humor.  I really enjoyed it and may even read it again.",5,1
4779353,Beautifully Written Paranormal Dystopia,"This beautifully written paranormal dystopia is a book that captures you and doesn't let go. It is a fast paced read about powerful but peaceful Guardians who only want to protect the world and help those who have forgotten that they too are Guardians.The story is mainly about a girl named Sidney Davenpport. When she was young it was prophesized that she would help the earth from those who were bent on leading it into darkness. She is gifted and a bit wild, which is why her mentor calls her Wildchild.She and her brother, Danik, are asked to break into a military based to retrieve some information. While doing this she is caught and is ordered to be executed. She is sent to the USS Nonnah where she meets ad eventually falls in love with the captain, Samaru Waterhouse.The Guardian's Wildchild is filled with New Age thoughts and wisdom. It has a bit of a surprising ending to it that I will admit bothered me somewhat. Overall I really enjoyed this book and the journey it took me on.",4,1
6950930,Perfect for compact Backup,"I have now bought 2 sets of these to keep one with each of my laptops and I couldn't be happier. These take next to no space but allow me to sync and charge everything I own. Finally, if you need longer cables you can simply carry one USB 2.0 extension cable and use it with whatever cable you are using at the time.Pros:- Tiny- Appropriately flexible: not as flexible as a normal cable, but not completely rigid either- Complete: syncs/ charges nearly every modern device that exists - iphone, android phone, ipad, kindle, hard drive, etc.- Heavy Duty: these should outlast any of my regular cablesCons:- Short (for obvious reasons)- USB 2.0 (adequate, but not future proof)Conclusion:I can't think of a better solution to have every cable I could possibly need in such a small package. I highly recommend these to anyone who travels, or even just transports a laptop to and from work or school and wants to be prepared.",5,1

4693718,Evolution of Insanity,"This author has a wonderful way of making you think about, and observe, your world around you. I felt like I was in Chicago, and though I have only spent a few months there, I have watched a lot of thses types of antics go on around me. If we could slow our world down, and really pay attention, what would we see?And would the seeing bring us closer to understanding? Or would it bring us closer to our own insanity--and there is where you find, The Evolution of Insanity.I have not enjoyed reading something so much in my life. I believe we'll be listening to Heresh Daswani on great talk shows, like Chicago on NPR, showing his delightful insights, for many years to come.I easily gave this book 5 stars",5,1
7810348,Picky Fussy Buyer,"The bottom of the bowls are 'recessed' so if you wash them face down in the dishwasher, you're left with 'standing' water which has to be shaken-off or wiped dry. This water (which could be 'grungie') might be splashed onto the clean dishes below if you wash them on the top rack and are not carefulwhen you unload them. Other than this, they are fine. I would not have bought them if I had known this though.",4,1
2147750,5 star review,"I truly love this series. The love every single emotion that flows through me as I read this series. I truly recommend this series. Yes, each book is short, but who cares. It is a great series and it adds to the mystery and excitement on whats going to happen next. Each book continues to get better and better. Love it...Kudos H.M. Ward!!!",5,1
884781,Clear consise reading,"This book explains the problem ignored by so many physicists. It makes a compelling argument that the universe depends on the observer and somehow the universe may not be real or fit into the reality people are used to thinking about. I'm not through the whole book yet and I'm sure I'll want to re-read it, but it has me questioning if we really exist and even if we do exist, that the universe is nothing like people think. I have reached the part about Bells Theorem and this is the nitty gritty of the book I think. Highly recommended since it treats not just the quantum physics realities but how we people are an integral part of the reality we encounter in quantum mechanics that makes you question what existance really is.",5,1

2186822,Disappointing in plot and presentation,"I had hoped this book would be done in alternating points of view from all four girls (like If There Be Thorns). Instead, Brooke is our narrator, and the reader is limited to her perceptions. The other three girls become  typecast by their personalities (the wimp, the brain, the troublemaker) and  we lose the intimacy we had with them in their books.  Also, I hope the  plot was meant to show that runaways are on a one-way street to nowhere,  because that's how I felt while reading it. Not the thrilling finale I was  hoping for.",2,0
9412104,Probably it is a cultural thing but,it was terribleee slow movie and without any sense for me. THere is not moral to the story and I didn't understand the point of the story. The scenes were so naive that it was laughable. But It is true that I watched in 3 times and I skipped a lot of the scenes so may be there is some plot. The way the actors behave it is as they are in the 19 century of before but I guess that is the way Korean behave in normal life.,2,0
5796400,"What can I say, it's HEART",Some of HEART's best music.  They are never a disappointment.  But then I am their biggest fan.  I just hope Anne and Nancy remember the scorpion on the stage .........and that I stomped it flat for them.,5,1
3340814,Another great Cindy Gerard book,"I have missed Cindy Gerard.  I devoured the entire bodyguard series and the first Black Ops books, so was thrilled when this new book came out.  I found the story compelling and the right blend of action and romance.  I liked the flashbacks, but would have liked a bit more to really buy that Wyatt had been pining for Sophie all these years.  I think that Gerard made Wyatt a great, sexy and strong lead.  I enjoyed that most of the book was from Wyatt's point of view. I love that her female characters have strength and backbone.  The action level was high, exciting and yet believable enough.  We got to spend time with all of our favorite BOIs.  I would have liked to have a few gaps filled in and wished that it hadnt been so easy to guess the bad guy, but still a very enjoyable read.",4,1
8434665,Echo is amazing!,I absolutely loved this book! Echo is an amazing character with so much to offer. Pair her up with Hawke and they are unstoppable! This is a one of a kind book that will keep you fully entertained and wanting more!,5,1
5094232,Loved it!,"I put this book aside as a ""maybe"" to read awhile ago.  Yesterday I had a few hours to read and once I started I couldn't put it down (in fact I was up at 5am this morning to finish it).  I had to know whether the main character, Kelli,  would make it back to her 25 year old self having fast forwarded to her 50th birthday and what repercussions her visit in the future would have.  I grew to love Kelli more and more as the book progressed and she discovered another side to herself, let go of the superficial and embraced a warm and loving experience.  A very clever concept with some wonderful new technology to be introduced to as we move 25 years ahead, the author might want to patent some of these ideas, just incase!  Highly recommend Fast Forward and look forward to reading more books by Juliet Madison.",5,1
3775217,First book I've loved in a long time!,I was not expecting something so thrilling! This book was a real page turner and was excited to see what would happen next! The characters were so real life it was hard to believe it didn't actually happen. The ending was so wonderful I actually read it twice to make sure I had read it right. You have to really pay attention to this book to love it as much as I did. It really was an amazing read!,5,1

I mean, we were all there at one point in our lives, but I don't care to revisit it without a really good reason.  This book doesn't have any reason, much less one that is good enough.",2,0
3186946,Awesome version of the Physical Law of Attraction!!!,"You know how you can meet someone for the first time and forever be stuck with the first impression of either liking them or hating them. This is the basic premise for the law of attraction which is the secret of manifestation. We are attracted to others 'people and things' and others are attracted to us that match our vibration. This vibration has been refered to by many names: feelings, aura, energy, intuition, etc. I believe Divine Matrix takes the law of attraction to the next step by manifesting it into the physical. It's an amazing concept to behold and I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for the physical aspect of the law of attraction. The Divine Matrix takes on the mechanical aspects of the law of attraction. It is a more technical version than the others. If you are a sci-fi buff then I believe this book will work better for you than the others.",5,1

3569203,Excellent Read,"This was a very interesting book, it made me think of our daily struggles and how satan tries to trick us with his schemes.  But when you speak God's work against them, that is the warfare to win the battle.  Awesome read, would make a great movie!!!!",5,1
2360239,So helpful,"I'll be traveling to Russia and needed a very quick crash course in speaking the language.  I've learned other languages but this course, by far, is the easiest way to do so.  I've been teaching myself to read Russian but after listening to these CDs, I've realized I was really off on my pronunciations.  Not only have these CDs strengthened my speaking ability but they've made reading the language so much easier as well.  These CDs will definitely complement any studying you are doing of this language.  True, the CDs may initially seem repetitive and a tad boring but get past lesson one and you find that this really works Give it a chance and you will learn quite a bit in these sixteen lessons.",5,1

1492557,"Excellent read, even better than the movie","20% rocket science, 80% snapshot of a time and place called Coalwood West Virginia.  Homer Hickam&#8217;s biography perfectly illustrates one young man&#8217;s quest to escape the coal black future of his surroundings, earn his father&#8217;s respect and love, and find himself through the tumultuous years of adolescence.  From his first attempted rocket launch, which acted essentially as a pipe bomb destroying his mother&#8217;s fence, to the loss of his virginity Mr. Hickam does an excellent job of capturing the trials and tribulations of growing up and conveying them in a way that allows the reader to connect with the story and will leave you remembering your own coming of age.  If you enjoyed the movie &#8220;October Sky&#8221; you can rest assured that as is usually the case once again the book is much better than even that excellent film.",5,1
8081409,Super Rock,"In my opinion the Rock is up there with the greats of Wrestling, i.e Hulk Hogan and the Undertaker. Not only a great wrestler but also a great showman who brought excitement to the WWE. This is the perfect book for all WWE fans, and particularly fans of the Rock",5,1
5073227,pulls you in and leaves you wanting more!,"I read this along with my Goodreads group, David Estes Fans and YA Book Lovers Unite, downloading my own copy which is offered for free at this time on Amazon and Smashwords.Please don't tell me there isn't more! I was pulled in right away and loved it. I have a strong feeling there will be more coming soon; this story is that good. I can easily see this becoming a series or trilogy. This has to be only the beginning of meeting Miranda, and I want to find out more about this world the author has created.A few months were skipped over in the middle of the story, which is the only reason I rated this four stars instead of five; however, this is a short story - not a novella nor a novel - and maybe those months weren't that essential to the overall story. I still would love to know what happened during that time, and I am definitely looking forward to more from this author!",4,1

9421968,"Olympus Has Fallen, the Redux","2013 spawned two movies about the takeover of the White House:Olympus Has Fallenand this, White House Down.I'm hard pressed to not compare the two.  Each has the White House compromised allowing unsavory characters access to the President of the United States.  Each has a somewhat washed out character who saves the day.  Olympus Has Fallen clocks in at 1:59 while White House Down comes in at 2:15.  Both have a black man as president at some point or another.I was entertained but not so much that I would like or need to see this (or the other) movie any time soon.",4,1

It was nice to get a book from Mel's point of view this time around, & I really enjoyed seeing how her & Shelley's storyline a wrapped up. This & it's sequel are definitely worth reading!",5,1
1130462,PERFECTION!,"This is a wonderful mystery series, and this last book is absolutely the best. Knowing how Ms. Penny spins her tales, I set aside two nights to read this book and was not disappointed.Every character from Three Pines can make you laugh and cry and fall in love with them.  Those who work with Gamache are fortunate in having a superior who will never fail them.While this book does have its murder mystery, there is a bigger plot that continues from her last book and is a very dark tale of evil for the sake of power. The suspense was terrific.Louise Penny has won quite a few awards for Inspector Gamache and Three Pines, every one well deserved. How can anyone not love Gamache?",5,1

3269242,Great Book,My kids love the pictures in this book.  Since they don't actually read yet they make up stories for the different pictures.  It has been a lot of fun.  The only downside is that this book is almost $20.00 and my kids are going trash in a matter of months since the pages are paper. (The book flap disappeared in the first hour).  If you have the disposable income for an item like this I think its a great one.,4,1

556695,A Masterful Mystery.,"Rei is from California. She's bright, independent, and wears unacceptable athletic shoes. Her Japanese aunt works hard at putting the finishing touches on her wayward niece, including lessons in flower arranging. As Rei  bows deeply and tries to follow the elaborate formal rituals of polite  society, she gets deeper and deeper in trouble: a corpse, an unacceptable  suitor, a philandering master teacher, and several attempted murders.  It's  the kind of wonderful setting in which the death threats are in haiku, the  flower shears are gruesome weapons, and any one of the oh-so-polite  Japanese has ample reason to have killed the victim. Rei is a thoroughly  likeable protagonist, the setting is evocative and finely drawn, and the  plot is filled with dark passion and unexpected twists and turns. I am  delighted with this book, and will read more novels by Sujata Massey.",5,1

5111398,I LIKED IT!,"This book had lots of good information in it. It really wasn't  just about looking expensive. It was more about finding the right clothes which will ,in turn, make you look expensive. Overall, this is a good book for those who need to learn the basics for looking good.",5,1
4778325,Hysterically funny,"I got it when it was free download. After reading so many bad books from free downloads, I was skeptical about this one to say the least, with the peculiar title of the book and all. But as soon as I started reading, I started laughing out loud, which I usually don't do when reading, and kept laughing until the end of the book. It's a great satire, sweet, short and hilarious. Now that it's not free, I have gifted this book to several people and they all enjoyed it. Since I've read all three books by RJ Silver, I now read his blog religiously for more laugh while I anxiously wait for his next book.",5,1

1213411,Disappointing,"Sorry, but I just did not enjoy this book at all. To be honest, I gave up towards the end  and did some speed reading to finish it. Language was a personal issue for me. I do not like the spelling of English dialects..... I find it confusing and distracting. The use of swear words was unnecessary. Not as bad as in her book 'casual vacancy' which I stopped reading for that reason. For me, I shall give Ms Rowlings a miss from now on.",2,0
4669817,Gothic Romance At It's Best!,"When I bought Into The Grae, I was skeptical. A Christian Gothic? How? Why? But once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Ms. Beaumont's writing shines in this wonderful Christian Gothic Romance. Reading it was a joy, I finished in one evening. Well done!! What more can I say, I highly recommend this book. It will be on my reader for a long time, just so that I can read it again and again.",5,1
2342952,boring,I thought this would be riveting reading. But it was so boring. the reviews were so good I decided to buy it.

Further I agree that they should have never divulged that it was Seal Team 6, and for that matter any special force called to take out  an important asset while still engaged in a war.

2519139,One Mountain Away,I really enjoyed this book!  It is a story of realizing that we all make mistakes-some bigger than others--and that we have to face up to them.

Accardo blows everyone away with these performances; his fingerboard is on fire. Accardo is one of the best today, if not the best. The range, tone, dynamics, and profoundness of his violin is only rivaled by a few of the greats. These performances are as the master, Paganini, would have played them. They are some of the most dynamic displays of violin playing the world has ever experienced. They are definitely in a class of their own. Also, the recording is excellent; it's crystal clear with Accardo's violin capturing an unbelievable sound quality; such range-WOW!. I know why Beethoven only wrote one violin concerto; how can you compete against Niccolo.",5,1

Long buried love quickly rises to the surface and the two lovers pick up almost where they left off. Hannah is in for a bit of a surprise when Adam reveals he has a son, and they have to face the past to move forward.This really sweet story of long lost love recaptured grabbed my attention from the first page. I couldn't stop reading until I was finished. It gives such hope that some things like true love never die. I absolutely loved it!",4,1
4878267,A great taste of things to come.,"I downloaded this novella for free from Amazon during a promotion.It is rare for me to attach to characters soon.  Too much information and I am turned off the story, not enough and I feel as if I am a voyeur.  This short prequel got me interested and invested in a few pages.  Quite a remarkable feat, if you ask me.  This novella proved a nice appetizer with promise of great things to come.  I can't wait to read the first in this novella.  I give this short prequel a flying 5 * review.",5,1
3849130,Blah,"I really regret spending money on this book. It seems as though it was written by someone who has never really lived life, and get's inspiration for edgyness from TV shows and what not. Nothing about it was believeable and most of the dialoge between characters was lame. Almost as if it was all the things you wish would happen in your head when you are 15.",1,0
1554219,Fine book on shakespeare,This is one of the best books that I have ever read on William Shakespeare. Greenblatt uses the plays combined with the snippets we know from the bard's past to create an astonishing biography.Greenblatt is an entertaining writer who clearly knows the plays inside and out. He has drawn from extensive analysis of the text to create a complex and thoroughly convincing picture of the great writer. This is a great book and should be read by anyone with more than a passing interest in Shakespeare.I was particualry impressed with his chapter on Macbeth which drew up on its links to the Gun powder plot and beyond. He places Shakespeare as a man of his time whode writing transcended it.,5,1
1314639,A great tribute to a great horse,"I purchased my first horse in 1964 and I remember hearing all about Snowman so this story was particularly interesting for me.  Some parts were a bit repetitive and it would have been nice to perhaps have had a little more detail on the day to day lives of the owner and the horse, but it certainly brought back lots of memories and put a tear in my eye.  A very inspirational story.  I would recommend it.",4,1
797896,The Secret Life of Bees,This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The setting is in South Carolina in the middle of the Civil Rights movement during the time when President Johnson signed the bill allowing black people to register for the vote. Life lessons learned during a young girl's growing up period gently handled by an unlikely source makes this novel stand out as great.  I would recommend this book to young and old alike.,5,1
9282619,QUITE INSIGHTFUL,"I do music photography. Unfortunately not for a living because nowadays everybody and their mother has a camera. Photographers are a dime a dozen.Guys like Robert and Mark Weiss are fortunate because they started doing this many years ago, way before there were so many restrictions on photographers.They got their foot in the door early and that's huge. Having early photos of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and others is priceless. A fellow photographer told meabout Robert so I rented the DVD and I enjoyed it. You don't have to be a music photographer to enjoy this DVD but if you are you'll probably relate to a lotof what Robert talks about. I think it's great that he tries to help up and coming artists since he's got a lot of connections in the business. You canrent the DVD and check it out like I did before you buy it. I enjoyed it and I'm sure some of you will as well.[...]",4,1
7827105,Does what they are supposed to do,"When I reviewed everything Amazon had, I really wanted to purchase the cuter looking bags with the multi-colored tags. I'm just too darned practical because I bought these instead, double the number of bags for the same price as the cute ones. They are very light weight, very easy to see through/ scan through. They just are not cute or sexy. I'm okay with that. One reviewer complained that they are stiff, but I don't have any issues or regrets. They are made from recycled water bottles. They are very sturdy, and I am glad I purchased the large size- perfect/versital. I really enjoy using them, glad I bought them. The ten bags come packed in a small mesh bag with a string tie that is great for garlic, ginger, etc. (So you are really getting 11 bags.) The large size is perfect for apples, peppers, broccoli, kale, etc. String ties cinch close and pull open very easily.",5,1
8436487,Please don't judge me by my e-reader,I found this story to be a lot of fun to read.  I noticed some reviews complained about the characters being &#34;over the top&#34; but I think that's part of the reason I loved this story.  Maybe it's all those Star Trek reruns I watched in the 70's but I found the accidental interaction and the potential impact to be reminiscent of those episodes.  And goodness I can just imagine what some alien would be trying to come up with if they used the books on my Nook to come up with an idea of how to care for me.,4,1
7904099,GREAT CUTTER,"I saw one similar on a shopping tv channel at a much higher price. I bought this one instead. I tried cutting pineapple with a regular knife, it was just not worth the trouble. This pineapple slicer did the trick in about a minute and cut the slices perfectly.  I would certainly recommend this unit.  Now I will be buying more fresh pineapples.  The fresh pineapple does taste much much better than the canned ones.  Fresh has a sweet and not tart taste.  If on the fence, buy it you will agree that it is so easy.",5,1

2686716,Beautiful book!,"This is a lovely book full of stunning pictures from all around Turkey. It's pretty enough to prominently display on a coffee table or counter, but functional because the recipes are easy to follow and delicious!  We just got this book 2 days ago and have already made three recipes (all successful). My only wish would be to see the Turkish name for every recipe (not just a select few).  And, my husband (from Turkey) says the recipes are really tasty, but they're adaptations of traditional recipes.  So, if you're looking to impress some Turkish friends, be aware you're making ""new"" versions of traditional foods- and they're quite tasty!!!Enjoy Turquoise, it makes me want to go back to Turkey every time I open another page... makes me hungry too!",5,1

I can't wait to see how they surmount the troubles chasing them in he next book. It is definitely worth taking the time to read this series.",5,1
7967844,Enjoyable,"REVIEW CONTAINS A POSSIBLE SPOILERI really liked this one, sometimes I really want to read the story which puts the lovers and their friends against the world instead of all the breaking up and making up stuff. This one really delivers in this aspect, and I liked the friendship and comaradery of all the guys at the ranch.The only niggle I have is that when story tries to be a historical romance, I want more indication that it is actually a historical romance. Settings were barely sketched imo and no way I believed that so many people in the 19 century would be so very accepting of gay cowboys living nearby. I mean, there are people who are not accepting them of course, but as a whole atmosphere of the town is way too accepting in my opinion.But again, as costume historical it worked well for me. I liked the characters and the plot turns very much.",4,1
6964394,great images,"Took awhile to get things set properly.  Recommend that digital zoom feature be turned off.  The viewfinder tends to give impression that image is great when it enlarged too much and finished picture looks bad.  Great images can be made with it off.  If subject is too far away, reducing picture size will enlarge it (bring it in closer) and still give satisfactory sharpness and detail.Initially, I did not like the camera, but after getting it set properly it has become my favorite.  This was purchased as a backup for my first one.  14MP gives great details, especially on macro shots and images at less than full zoom.",5,1

Douglas stars as a former big city car salesman who was at the top of his game....until unscrupulous business practices put an end to it all.  What remains is his seemingly insatiable appetite for very young women--no matter the cost.  And the cost is high, as his appetite seems to have a negative effect on practically every aspect of his personal life and relationships; from that with his daughter and grandson, to his own girlfriend.  And while a health scare may have exacerbated an already healthy appetite for the opposite sex, despite his bad behavior the protagonist is surrounded by a cast of people who have only his best interest in mind.  A rather interesting tale, but not a movie I would rave over.-DYB",4,1

I wasn't expecting anything more than 90 minutes of escapist entertainment, and that's just what I got! This movie had some good scenes and some dumb ones, some cheap special effects, some bad lines and some silly sexual content. So did ""Return of the Jedi"", if you want to get technical. This isn't really even a horror movie. It's more like the old drive-in ""B"" movies that Elvira built her career on. I certainly wouldn't build a library out of movies of this quality, but there definitely is a certain amount of entertainment value. Consider this what it is, a well-done low budget movie, not a major studio blockbuster. Independent studio creativity doesn't always have to mean art films, after all!",4,1

The material is like that of a diver's wetsuit and it fits snugly against the container yet stretches enough so that you can easily zip it open and closed.  As another reviewer mentioned, the strap does end up being at the bottom of the container, which seems a bit awkward.  However, you can rest assured knowing that the lid is tightly snapped in place.The case should also help keep your goodies insulated for up to 4 hours. I have not had the opportunity to test and verify that claim.  Yet, I have kept a Japanese rice and veggie lunch (cold) in it for a couple of hours and it kept nicely.",5,1

It is a well written story about a rancher fostering three children and a flighty but fun young woman Angie who can't make up her mind what she wants to be when she grows up, and at the age of twenty-four it would seem high time. The one thing missing in this fun story is an epilogue. I, as I am sure a lot of readers would like to know if rancher Toby gets to adopt the children.",4,1

1003364,Fantasy for the non-fantasy reader,"My husband, an avid fantasy reader, has tried for years to get me interested in the genre.  One evening when I was desperate for something to read, he handed me this book and begged me to give it a chance.  I was hooked from page one!  The writing is exceptional, and the characters--especially the women--are well developed.  What strikes me most about Martin's work is that it is brutally honest and the characters act and think like real people...they don't seem at all like the stereotypical &quot;heroes&quot; I've encountered in other books.  One word of caution to those who don't read a lot of fantasy, be sure to give yourself a few chapters to get into this book.  Until I figured out how this world worked I found myself confused a lot, and I kept having to ask my husband to clarify certain points.  Once I &quot;got it&quot; though, I had no trouble reading. This book (and entire series) is so amazing it transcends genre and can appeal to any reader.",5,1
2891053,Inspiring,"The Gentlemen's Club is a book that is about two things - empowerment and hope.  I also think it is about inspiring - each and every women to take ownership of herself, her body, her emotions and the direction in her life.This touching and deeply felt memoir was the kind that I truly love to read - making me feel happy, sad, disgusted with humans, all the while finding that redemption is possible.  While one human being can make it all horrible, the counter balance is another human being that makes it okay and allright.  This book is the perfect example of this.The author has courage, faith and a deep belief in herself and other human beings, which is more than I can say, at times and I have never had to experience half of what she has.This book is written by a woman, for women everywhere.  Inspiring and deeply moving.",4,1

1947091,Good introduction,"This was a pretty good introduction to the Maya. It has a lot of good reference materials in it, such as time lines and maps. In some areas the writing is a little dry and dull, but overall I felt like I had gotten a fairly good overview of the Maya when I was done.

9227948,Task Force,"This is a good movie about the development of naval aviation and carriers. Gary Cooper and Jane Wyman give their usual fine performances. The movie is a flashback of Gary Cooper's life right beginning at the time he is retiring from the Navy, going over the many memories he had in his struggle to promote carriers and naval aviation, finally to see it at its finest capability, effectiveness, and almost prolific numbers in the Pacific theater, beating down the Japanese air forces and island fortresses. It has some authentic aerial film that you see in most war flicks but still this is a worthwhile purchase to add to your war flick library and an enjoyable film to watch. Boy was Jane Wyman was really beautiful in her prime.",4,1

However, in this production he is outdoing himself with a vibrant survival story about the journey of three young back to their home from which they have been taken due to Australia's policy in regards to aborigines.  Rabbit-Proof Fence provides a great opportunity to visually experience the girls struggle to reach their goal to get home.  This struggle elevates the meaning of hope in our world.  In short, the story itself offers a brilliant cinematic experience with Kenneth Branagh as A. O. Neville enhancing the overall experience as well.",5,1

3711651,Book with an actual story!,"There are so many books that have no substance, this one does. There is more to the story than just the love scenes and I love it.

3102739,Wowza!,"It took me a good part of the book I think, to remind myself of what had happened in the previous 2 books and the part each character had played in the story since I had finished reading the previous 2 books late last fall.The book was full of so many twists and turns and half-truths and avoidance, especially on the part of Hudson, that for a while I couldn't decide whether I wanted Alayna and his relationship to work out, or if I was hoping she'd just drop him and look for happiness elsewhere.Despite my ambiguity, the ending was worth the trouble and the wait and perhaps was all the sweeter for it.",4,1

7161783,Great reviews from my crew...,"I handed this to my teen sons and husband to review and they all thought it was a worthwhile addition to their iPad gear. They played a ""shoot-em"" game (or a more accurate description these days would be a ""laser-em"" game) on the iPad without the joystick, then with it. According to my guys, the game (Solomon's Keep) was much easier to play with the joystick than without. It made it a more tactile experience, and their movement and targetting was more accurate. The suction cups held up well - no sliding around on the pad. They also remarked that it didn't get in the way of their game playing, as they originally thought it would. So it gets a thumbs up from my crew.",5,1

But as I have grown more found of the subject of history in my later years, I freely confess a newfound respect for this book.  I now relish its length and attention to detail.  So . . . a good book for anyone already interested in the subject, but an intimidating choice for the casual reader.",4,1
8986994,Tom Cruise plays somone other than himself,"This is an interesting role for tom Cruise. Many times, you'll see him playing himself in films - by that I mean, you never quite lose the line between him and his character.And that works for him.In this film, you get a glimpse of how he is learning to transcend his own character and lose himself more fully in his roles. As he matures as an actor, and not just a blockbuster draw, I really think those kinds of transformations are going to be his best asset.The story in the film is touching and ironic, and is respectful of all the cultures represented within it. Are they accurate portrayals? That depends on which side of the lens you're on.",4,1

There aren't enough city maps so you need to buy a Lonely Planet guide as well.  I love the DK guides to London and Paris where the neighborhoods and sights are so intricate that the DK diagrams and walking tours are immensely helpful.  The restaurant recommendations turned out to be rather poor from the DK guide.  Frommer's and Lonely Planet were a lot more reliable.If you want a guide that will help you sort out what's worth seeing, try the Michelin Neos instead.",2,0
3880364,Dalton,"This book was a cute, fun read. Dalton you can't help but fall in love with him right off, ""my driver's nearby. I could give you a lift, as a thank you for allowing me to hide in your bathroom like a coward."" He's a jokester, ""dinner tonight?"" he asked. ""Unless you're still mad at me for shushing you."" His dark eyes were hungry and wolf-like, impossible to look away from. ""Shushing you is something I swear I'll never do again."" He's also a naughty boy, ""I can't stop thinking about the other night in the car. I should have laid you back on the seat, put your legs up on my shoulders, and pulled off your panties with my teeth."" Oh my word! He makes any situation fun even if it is a serious one, ""I'm sorry to hear that. And I'm doubly sorry to be poking my boner into your belly button while you're telling me this very personal story."" I didn't like how there was a cliffhanger of sorts I didn't realize this was a damn series.",5,1
9273379,Serious weirdness,"But I mean that in a good way. The animation style tends self-consciously towards the unpolished - but the stiff, jerky motions perfectly suit the sense that these characters could  have been plastic toys, right down to the little stand beneath their feet, in my own childhood toybox. The main characters, Cowboy (a cowboy), Indian (an Indian), and Horse (you guessed it) have an equally self-conscious feel about their characters' names.What really makes this strange little treat is its surreal meanderings from one improbable scene to another - the upside-down aquatic village, horses playing specially modified pianos, and even (spoiler) a battle fought using pigs and swordfish as projectiles. Of the little rational flow the creators left in this production, I probably missed a good portion. I watched without subtitles, but admit French to be among my many lacks. All the more reason to see it again!-- wiredweird",4,1
2981422,Very Interesting book with a different view from what you typically read,"If you have read Amanda Knox' book, you must read this one as well. It reveals a lot of information that most of the American media has not addressed. The writer comes across as very knowledgable. It is obvious that she does not care for Knox or her family, but despite that bias it seems to me she did not overly skew the information against Knox.",4,1

Think of it as piece of paper and pencil that will last you for several years without any paper waste.  It's has same contrast as #2 pencil on white paper, so it's readable just fine. Once you erase page, there's no going back, so don't keep your Swiss bank account number on it.I especially like that it comes with 4 nice magnets ready to be attached (sticky) to the back of the tablet. It also comes with stylus holder.",5,1

693953,Surprisingly entertaining,I picked up this book because I am a fan of classic American cars and have a 57 Chevy Belair Hardtop in my garage.  Seems only natural I would like this book.  And I did.This is the story of a tough guy from a rough home and journey with a 57 Chevy.  We get the story of his life and also the story of the car's life as he traces it back through all its previous owners.  An entertaining story as it weaves through the changes of time for both man and machine.,5,1

9429379,Nice twist in end to Final Season,"I enjoy all the Father Dowling mysteries and this was no exception. That being said, one episode, the one in Malibu, just didn't work very well. It is out of the traditional Chicago setting that is crucial to Father Dowling, but the characters are different. Father Dowling is less patient, and Steve looks like she is going into acting.  All the other episodes were a fitting end to the series. The last episode has a very nice twist (no plot spoiler) that actually redeems one of the characters.",5,1

Anyone who has ever lived in NY or NJ knows guys like this, but so what.The one thing that might have redeemed Raging Bull would be if there was any light at all on why he was the way he was. And if that's too much to ask, I'd settle for why anybody would make a movie about him.In the end its really just a brilliant portrayal of an angry lowlife.",2,0
3350471,Interesting read about life as a pediatric resident,"I was drawn to this book because I enjoy medical memoirs.  Between Expectations is written by a Pediatric ER physician about her time as a pediatric resident.  There are harrowing stories about patients who died, who survived, and how these experiences impacted her.  There is even a chapter where she travelled to a foreign country to help administer medical care.  Overall, her writing is impressive in it's layers.  I can tell that she painstakingly chose each word to convey the exact meaning she was desiring it to.  Not surprising since she's a doctor!  The only knock on this book is that it is a little dense, and difficult to read for a layperson.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone considering the field of pediatrics.Other pediatricians who write include Perri KlassA Not Entirely Benign Procedure, Revised Edition: Four Years as a Medical Studentand Jennifer ShuFood Fights: Winning the Nutritional Challenges of Parenthood Armed with Insight, Humor, and a Bottle of Ketchup.  Both are recommmended.",4,1

I can handle &#34;intense Sean&#34; as long as there is some glimpse of &#34;loving Sean&#34; and there really wasn't any of that in this one.

6114079,a solid revival after the suicide attempt that was St. Anger,"nothing here to complain about, its got all the catchy riffs, epic moments, and awsome solos we came to expect from one of the pioneers of metal. as greedy as i think they are, and as little i like them as people, i can still give them respect for their accomplishments in music. metal wouldnt be where it is today if it wasnt for metallica. part of why i always thought they were perfectly named. its not a full revival of their gloy days, but its their best album in over 15 years, and thats more than i could've ever hoped for after what they released, especially the atrocious St. Anger (where were the solos? where was the variety? what happened?) oh well, good to be long past the days of that album. Death Magnetic is a sign that these guys still have what it takes, and a sign of more good(possibly even better) music from Metallica in the future.",4,1

7803336,Go stuff your stuff!,"Bought this to hold a down comforter in the off months and it's everything I could want at a nice price.  Size matches up the listed dimensions, it does not have a tacky plastic smell and is nicely ventilated with lots of tiny holes so nothing should get too musty.Took a fairly plump, king-sized comforter without feeling like any seams would bust or with undue amounts of force to stuff it in.The &#34;see through&#34; side keeps you from having to guess what you stored and there's a couple of light duty handles for pulling it out from under the bed with minimal hassles.  They don't look like they'd take a lot of tugging to don't load the chest heavily or put it someplace where you need real effort to get it back out, it's just not designed for that.It's just the right sizer to slide under a bed or up on a closet shelf.  I'm going to be getting some more of these for blanket, sheet and towel storage.  You can't beat the convenience or the price.",5,1

1813268,"Just like Robert, this book epitomizes going against the crowd..","I'm going to keep this review simple and sweet. &#34;Retire Young Retire Rich&#34; is probably the most underrated book in the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series and probably the 1 book in the series (thus far) that is undervalued and (to insert another preposition) overlooked. Most likely, the reason for that is because this book really does not discuss much about financial issues and advice. Instead, this book is focused on and can be summed up by one verb/word: Capitalize. What does that mean? That's difficult to say to anyone who hasn't read this book yet, since there are so many layers to that verb/word. Interpret that verb/word the way you want to.Whatever the interpretation, disabuse your mind of Robert's 2 popular books (i.e. Rich Dad, Poor Dad & Cash Flow Quadrant) and read this book to go against the crowd.",5,1
4168682,An Interesting Epic,"I picked up the book by chance after reading the two other reviews.  I felt as if I were reading a ""Gone with the Wind"" for the Viking era.  A great historical fiction that offers up a rich tapestry of the early Scottish and Pictish societies as they struggle against the Viking invaders as well as old beliefs that still hold sway in the acceptance of Christianity.  However, be warned that this is definitely not a romance novel.  The heroine, even accounting for the time when she lives, is not a likable person and keeps making rash, unwise decisions that hurtle her from one disaster to another.  The only redeeming quality is her constant devotion to her son.  The jarl, despite being a berserker and all that it entails, comes across as a more sympathetic character.  The book left me wondering what'll happen to them once her famed beauty fades and her son is properly assimilated to the Viking society.  ""Gritty"" is the right word.",4,1

My mother, who has always supported my very different views of life, has read this and says that everyone who is different should read it too. If you are a Goth, or if you just know someone who is - or even if you ever just wanted to know more about that Goth things any way - read this book. You will laugh and learn. And probably break down and shop too.",5,1
813774,"Engrossing, but not as good as Eon","I loved the first book, Eon. This one is tough for me to review - I was completely engrossed while reading it and didn't want to put it down. But I didn't like Eona herself as much as I did in the first book. I felt like she squandered so much potential and opportunity by not trusting anyone with the whole truth. I finished it more than a week ago and I still don't really know how I feel about it.

I'm usually more of a contemporary romance person, and this story made me realize I was missing a lot of different authors!I would recommend this book as one to get if you aren't certain you will enjoy the genre or the author.

The story epic in its scope, filling in gaps left in the earlier books and tying many threads together as Harry and his friends struggle to complete the tasks given to them by Dumbledore.  The challenges they face at times seem impossible to meet, but they struggle through their doubts and through teamwork and a bit of luck, arrive at the final showdown with Lord Voldemort, where Harry finally meets his destiny.For fans of Harry Potter, this book will be both sweet and bitter.  This book finishes Harry's tale with grand style that should prove satisfying those who have fallen in love with our young hero and his friends.  But it is also sad, because it is the end of his story, and we can no longer look forward to hearing more about these wonderful characters.  I guess we'll just have to go back and read them again...",5,1

They make decent machines over here, man."" p.384.)then this is the book for you.  I kept reading hoping that the action would pick up, but it never did.  I was angry at myself for wasting my time with this book.  Don't waste yours.  This is probably the worst of the Jack Ryan series (Jack Jr. is now the lead protagonist of the series).  I am so disappointed.  This may be the last Tom Clancy book I buy.",1,0

It is small and sits in a closet so I don't care that the wires are all ugly out the side.The one warning I have is on setting up a Networked Printer that is connected to the USB port. You're supposed to run a program off the CD, but that doesn't seem to do much. And neither of my machines would find the printer. I found the answer pretty quickly on the Asus site here: [...]The trick is you tell windows it is a Local Printer. Then there are a couple of port settings etc. and all is well.

The plot line, character development, pace and writing style were all excellent.

6705891,Almost Perfect,"It really ""does everything"" at a very reasonable price. The real time traffic is a bit off a hype in my opinion. It never really tells you anything you don't already know and it's not terribly accurate re the real traffic conditions ahead but as a nav system it's superb. It's terribly intuitive and instructions are really not necesesary at all. You just play with the unit and you can learn everything you need just by playing around for a minutwe or two. It's database in amazing and it gets you wherever you need effortlessly. I wish it had a compass in a corner when it was guiding you, but there are ways to figure out what direction you're traveling in even without this. And, as others have mentioned, the built-in speaker is definitely tinny sounding at 80% volume. Above that I'd say it's unuseable. But the Bluetooth features are top notch and the text to speech works perfectly. A very, very nice little unit at a ridiculously affordable price.",5,1
2133159,My review for Colorado Mandala,"Brian is a gifted literary writer who knows his subject and characters as if they are real, and the location as if a native. He paints vivid, colorful scenes with descriptive words and visual images as if painting a picture of his own backyard. From the canyons and caves, to the river beyond and across scrub brush prairies and plains to Colorado's red rock cliff dwellings, the landscape is a kaleidoscope mix of colors, shapes and texture. The characters' lives are just as colorful, the threads and fiber woven together into a compelling story of love, hate, sacrifice and forgiveness. As a Colorado native, born and raised in Colorado Springs, living a short few miles from Manitou, I know the territory well, where the story takes place. Brian speaks about Manitou as if he could have been my neighbor. I was a young adult during the period of time that his story takes place, during the Vietnam War. Brian gives the story, its location and characters credible authenticity.",5,1
696050,Had to finish it,"Wait for you is a different story then the paranormal series of Jennifer L. Armentrout. It's a contemporary love story that includes difficult topics like shame, guilt and trauma's from the past. Due to a character like Cam I'm not able to go lower then a 5 star rating. He must be the most patient, responsible and sweet guy that I've ever read about (and don't forget beautiful). He's just the guy that Avery needs after a period of loneliness. I loved the story because it has been written in a way that it grasps you from the start and sucks you in until the end. I felt like I was part of the story. But that has to do with the writing style of Jennifer L. Armentrout since I love all her books. I've included Wait for You in my favourite book list together with books like Hopeless (Colleen Hoover), Fallen too far (Abbi Glines), Pushing the limits (Katie McGarry) or Find you in the dark (A.

All the characters, from Harry, to Hermione, to Hagrid, to professor Dumbledore and Malefoy all rode to work with me.

With a sub-title of ""A New History"" I was looking forward to learning something ""new"" that I haven't learned from the first 100 books I've read on the subject. There was nothing ""new"" here and what is written and the writers style qualifies this book as one of the five worst books I have read on the subject. It is an extremely hard read since he uses compound sentences that string out for four or five lines. It requires very slow reading to get the point being made that often turns out to be his opinion, not a fact. Looks like the editor was out to lunch.

Night Wind had a horrific life as a child slave in mines and grew into an adult filled with revenge.  The Brothers at a Mission taught him to read and write and although he was educated his heart would not let him forget those who harmed him.  He captured Olena and she captured his heart.

How listening to your inner self, letting go and believing in your deep emotions can lead you to your true soul mate.The author wrote the first draft of this book many years ago while she was suffering from acute Pneumonia. She survived and ten years later decided to re-write the book.This is a personal, intimate and very honest true love story where the author is so transparent you could practically see right through her. Each sentence is written in such an emotional and poetic way that you can actually feel what she was feeling all those years ago and today.The book, ""Memoir of Love and Art"" unfolds at a leisurely pace allowing the reader to get a feel for the narrative.

Bondoux is obviously one of those authors that think needlessly killing off a few protagonists is the height of literary excellence.  I admit I don't like those kinds of endings, ruins the whole story for me, but it might be a little more palatable if it weren't done in such an off-handed and abrupt manner.Anyway it did spoil the story for me and I went away from it with a bad taste in my mouth.NOT RECOMMENDED.",2,0

However, I was not prepared for a book that turned out to be as real and accessible as the Robertson family appears on the tube.

Loss and redemption, rewarding perserverance, this book could stand on its own; it's almost too bad that it will be taken as a book by, and about, a reality TV family.Heartily reccomended!!",5,1
1065650,92 Year Old Mystery Maven,"This interesting series of mysteries features Dorothy, who at 92, is a ""feisty woman who refuses to let the aches and pains of old age stop her from enjoying her multifarious activities"".

She is also a volunteer with the sheriff's department, and when acting in that capacity, she wears her special cap. Because of Dorothy's age, her experience in life enables her to look inside the human heart, often picking up clues missed by others.This is the second book in the series of seven books featuring this character. Each of the books is named after a plant, usually a native wildflower. I found the book enjoyable and the story riveting.

All the character development and main character relationships are established in that first book.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very good read.  Once again, the author does a wonderful job with the mystery and keeping the reader wondering exactly who is the killer.  It just wouldn't have pulled me into the story as thoroughly without the background of these characters from the first book.There must have been some chapters proofread by different people, because the character of Roquelle Rik had her name changed to Rochelle and then back to Roqeulle at the end.  I've had an author tell me that sometimes an writer will do something like that on purpose, just to see how thoroughly the readers are invested in the story.  If that's what was done here, stop it!  It's irritating and takes away from the flow of the book.I'm looking forward to another in this series.",4,1

But anyways, I know the waiting 24 hours thing sucks but I just take advantage of that by reading a little bit of the chapter every 2 to 3 hours. You should try that so u don't have to waste money on the ticket thingymebobers that are overpriced. :) also when you read a little bit of the chapter of this story it gives u time to fantasize about what might happen next. This app is mainly for patient people I guess but if there wasn't the whole wait for 24 hours thing, it wouldn't be much of a story if you just rush through the chapters now would it?

Why?  Despite a little mystery  regarding the timeline of the story (it DOES take a moment to figure out the sequence of events), it was fully worth the small effort.  Also I was afraid it would be one of those touchy-feely movies that leave you feeling sad all over....  nope.  It was actually uplifting- though I couldn't put my finger on why.

2431852,Great Statistics Book,I bought Disovering Statistics Using SPSS out of curiosity to see if the book deserved all the complimentary reviews.  I'm pleased to report that the book lives up to its great reputation. Field takes a pretty boring and tedious subject (read: STATISTICS) and turns it into something interesting and exciting. Excellent ... excellent ... excellent.,5,1

1031294,A little disconnected,"The book divides easily into two topics--a layperson's discussion of the scientific research into time and an in-depth theologian's discussion of time. Both parts of the book are excellent, but the two sections are not tied together well. Nevertheless, it is an excellent read and useful for gaining a proper perspective on one's use of time. In the end Vaughn accomplished in me what she intended: she increased my peace as I live in time.",4,1

7726925,Revised review,"I believe I gave this a lukewarm review, but I would like to change that to a very good review.  The more I use it, the more I like some of of its subtle points.

588643,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it.","I have been waiting patiently to read my copy of The Strain, I had to give myself a free weekend without interruptions because part of me knew I wouldn't be able to put it down and I was right.Del Toro and Hogan have given us a tightly woven, fascinating, fun, and downright scary as heck vampire novel! It's a book that is full of so many themes; infection, family bonds, mystery, and legends. Its about one mans life long mission to seek out the very evil that will destroy the earth. It's about another mans job to find out what has killed a plane full of passengers and is now loose on the city. It's about being in your house and one by one your neighbors have turned into something so monstrous and incapable of reason, and all they want to do is have you join them.If you love Del Toro's films, then you will adore how he and Hogan have been able to imprint on the readers mind such brilliant images, horrifying and as clear as day. This is the beginning of a trilogy that is going to blow peoples minds.",5,1
7183547,Great for the price,"They work well for the price. I'm not expecting awesome sound from $30 earbuds, but again, for the price, they're pretty good. All I was looking for were a pair that had decent sound with mic and volume control, and these do great.My only issue is that you do get a lot of noise coming through when the cord comes in contact with stuff. Such as when it rubs against your clothing, you'll hear that through the buds. It's mainly noticeable when listening to lower volume stuff. Other than that, I can't complain.",4,1
1809498,Don't Tell,I really enjoyed this book so much. I read it in 2 days and if I hadn't been sleepy I would have stayed up all night the first night.The author has a talent in writing that makes you feel like you know the characters. It was filled with suspense that kept you on the egde of your seat but it also had a love story.I was so sad when the story ended I wanted to read more.After finishing the book I went to the author's website and found out that her next book won't be out until February 2004.And that Don't Tell was her first book. I give this book 5 stars.Pam,5,1
1331856,Incredible chutzpah,"What an annoying, gimmicky, pointless little screed.  Andersen apparently believes that she's offering an  &#34;Alternative history&#34; novel series.  What she has actually produced is an inane costume-romance wannabe, not even rising the the level of an interesting romance.  It attempts validity by gratuitously slapping the names of actually historical persons onto a few characters.  In fact you can't really call them characters; they're entities that should be arrested for impersonating a character.  That's especially true of the ones with historical names attached--any resemblance to the real person is purely accidental.Alternative history is a valid genre, demanding a significant grasp of the history from which it diverges and logical connections to it,. This period's events and people were infinitely more exciting, complex, and intense.  It takes incredible nerve to try to substitute this flat, thin tale.",1,0

1465160,Shift,"Entertaining pile of trivia about the English language (as well as many other languages). For example, &#34;the military vehicle the tank got its name because during its secretive experimental phase people were encouraged to think it was a storage receptacle.&#34;I'd had no idea how arbitrary the creation of our language was, and found myself quite stunned at times. Loved the idea that all languages might well be derivations of one original shared language.I found it interesting that in writing a book (published in 1990) that documents the haphazard progress of the English language, Bill Bryson himself seems unconsciously to illustrate a shift in usage by moving randomly from his preferred 'male as default' bias (most examples use 'he') to an occasional 'he or she' and a rare singular pronoun 'they.'Natasha HolmeAuthor of 'Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder'",4,1

7305333,"Well made, high quality","I've used a variety of the super cheap retractable cords and this one is by far the most solidly made. Although the cable is not thread-thin like the other cheapies, that is an asset. About the size of a Nilla wafer (minus the connector plugs) it is compact enough. I bought this to use with my iDevices as part of a comprehensive power system: retractable cable, micro USB to Lightning adapter, Apple 10W power block, and an Anker battery bought here. This should fulfill all my travel power needs. I will report back after I've used it a bit. My expectation is that the spring loaded retraction mechanism will be the point of failure.

A young Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges meet up and become fast friends in this well paced lighthearted comedic crime drama.The two outlaws steal cars, rob banks, score chicks and outsmart the cops in this off beat buddy road adventure. The supporting cast including George Kennedy, Geoffrey Lewis and Gary Busey keep this one full of fun and action.Bridges was nominated for best supporting actor in this film, I'm not so sure it's worthy, but it is an excellent fun performance.

When I bought the u64 back in Feb 2013 (not long after its release) it was the largest and fastest MicroSD available at the time, and it weighed in at a good price and backed up by SanDisk reputation.For me, and my Galaxy S3 {SCH-i535, currently with Android 4.3} this card has been a delightful slam dunk on all four counts.  I was reminded of this today when I slammed 30+gb of MP3's from my PC onto my S3's card.

And the  Woodstock cut of &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; was absolutely one of the most  intense renditions of any song at that concert.  And Jimi Hendrix was  there. Now, to even come close to Hendrix, one must whip-a**, and  &quot;Soul Sac&quot; does just that.  Check the drum solo.  Whoa.  &quot;Fried Neckbones&quot; also teems with bubbling intensity. And for you  Top 40 pop rocker dudes, &quot;Evil Ways&quot; should keep your  unadventursome ears off of the radio for a while.

644146,Fascinating,"I loved this book! From the first sentence the reader is sucked into a story which gets richer, more mysterious, and more fascinating with every turn of the page. Ann Patchett  is able to create a world that becomes so real to the reader, that I almost feel that I have been to the Amazon too. The characters are not like any people that I know, yet I found their stories compelling and believable. There are many themes to ponder while reading this book, I can imagine that book clubs would find much to discuss here.  But for the reader who just wants a great escape, this book will satisfy that urge.",5,1
6457991,Awesome  Speakers,I just setup the Z-5300 speakers and I am very impressed with the overall sound quality and the amount of sound these babies can put out. I am using a SoundBlaster Audigy ZS sound card and this seems to be a match made in heaven. The setup was fairly easy and my only complaint is the speaker wire on the Center and Left &amp; Right front speakers could be longer.  Also the Subwoofer is very large and I had a hard time finding a big enough space for it. At the price I paid for these speakers you can not beat the value. My biggest problem is that the rest of my family doesn't have the same appreciation of music and they keep turning the volume down.JR,5,1
8980496,"Mother, Jugs and Speed","Bill Cosby, Raquel Welch and Harvey Keitel star in this comedy as Mother (as in Mother hen), Jugs (enuf said) and Speed (a cop busted for selling speed).The story of two privately owned ambulance companies compete for the city contract in LA. our heroes work for F & B run by Harry Fishbine (Allen Garfield). Also as F & B staff is Larry Hagman & Bruce Davidson.This 1976 comedy is cute in spots, but does show its age. Cosby and Keitel seems seasoned for their roles. Whereas Welch seem out of place with this comedyThe film seems grainy and washed out. The story is good, which saves this DVD releaseBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",4,1

I expected her book to deliver no less, and I was not disappointed.While some of the information in the book is also on the podcast, I enjoy having the book next to my computer so if I have a question, I can quickly refer to the print version instead of having to locate the podcast on her Web site... or is that website? I'd better see if that is in the book. If not, I'll write to Mignon and ask her to explain. Ah, there it is; take a look at page 150.

5736730,An essential for opera people,"Considered, by many, to be the standard by which Tosca performances are judged.  This recording has a volume problem for me.  The orchestra is loud and some of the singing is barely audible, especially at the very beginning.  This is true with two separate sets of this performance that I bought; two different labels.  The EMI might be a little better.  It's still worth having, for sure.  I also have this on audio cassettes and the sound is more muffled, but more balanced.  I also have the Leontyne Price/Franco Corelli 1962 Met radio performance.  It is a miracle.  In 70 years of loving opera I have never heard more glorious singing.  The orchestra and enraptured audience response just add to the experience.  I would say that a Puccini lover must have both of these great performances.",5,1

It recognized The new hardware and played immediately..........for thirty minutes. Speaker powered off with loss of sound. error message appeared indicating speaker exceeded it's power allotment. I don't know, but evidently, the USB port can only supply so much power. This happened on two occasions. I tried contacting, via e-mail, Triton Technologies tech support, for an explanation, to no avail. So much for their support.Speaker also began causing system crashes when on the internet trying to observe videos. The dreaded Windows blue screen appeared and I had to reboot. This occurred three times before I, in my infamous wisdom, decided to unplug the Triton speaker. Have had no problems since.I will give the speaker five stars as an ideal and unique paper weight.

2768637,new and original,"Zoo Cityby Lauren Beukes; I thought this was a well-done science fiction story... very original with the combination of setting and idea (although Phillip Pullman gets a hearty nod). Set in South Africa in the not-so-distant future, Zinzi has been convicted of a serious crime, and thus is committed to a lifelong bonding with an animal (which also grants her a special power). This of course marks and separates her as a criminal...Zinzi is on the receiving end of just about every prejudice one can experience (plus the new one that is the basis for the story).. oh wait, she's decidedly heterosexual, so she misses that one... but she gets a dose of all the others at one point or another. A very sympathetic character with lots of backstory still untold. I look forward to learning more about her.",5,1

The story reads at a good pace and has just enough adventure to keep your attention.  You find yourself drawn to the characters and wanting everything to turn out right for Don Lorenzo and his friends.The genre is the Steampunk with a twist of an alternative earth.  I wasn't aware of this when I started reading the book so it took a couple of chapters to realize that all the characters where from the same time.If you are looking for a well written book that has adventure, fantasy, romance, and even a little humor; then read The Broken Sword.

I broke down and got one just out of shear curiosity. This radio is no joke! Unlike other cheap Chinese items I have had the distinct displeasure of purchasing, these particular radios are feature packed and of very acceptable quality when compared to the higher end hand held radios. In fact, I believe this radio is the &#34;Model T' of the HAM radio industry because it can enable the masses to get into HAM radio operation at very very low cost.

7723632,finally a feasible alternative to canned air,I've been shopping for an alternative to canned air.  I don't like canned air because it loses strength when it get's cold from prolonged use.What I like about this product.Good blast of air that can be sustained unlike the cans.Made in the USA.  Wow this and my new balance shoes.  Imagaine that.  We actually can build stuff here.Fairly effective and hopefully in the end saves money and the landfills.What I didn't like:The top of the unit has a gap and a lot of air blows out the gap.The attachments restrict the air flow and a LOT more air gets blown out of the gap.  It actually works better without the attachment.The filter is difficult to remove and it's not a very good fit.Very loud. It's a tradeoff > powerful sustained blast of air but loud and gets pretty warm.Overall the trade offs are in favor of the product definitely over the canned air but not sure if air compressor with water catcher isn't a better choice.,4,1

Amazon UK states 2.35:1 as the aspect ratio of their DVD version (this is the correct aspect ratio of the movie). Can anyone comment if the US version is also 2.35:1 and if it is an anamorphic transfer? As for the movie itself, it is a thriller unusually set in medieval times, beautifully photographed with excellent performances by Willem Dafoe and Paul Bettany. 4 stars.UPDATE May 23, 2007I've bought a Region 4 version... For those who care, the transfer is  a great-looking Anamorphic Widescreen one with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. This is most probably the same as Region 1, so the aspect ratio info posted by Amazon is incorrect.

But when I read these books I want to know there will be a happy ending, so that's okay with me.As well as having similarities, they are also different enough that they do not get confused in my mind.  I think that certainly says something about the writing of Ms. Foster.Yes, I got pissed at Josh quite a few times.  But if I were in his shoes would my mind have thought the same thoughts?  Probably.  Why is it that I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and be okay with characters finding insta-love, but when they try to think rationally I have a problem?As much as Josh upset me, I found him to also be the most thoughtful of the brothers in the way he remembers so many details about Riley and the things she has mentioned, even if just in passing.I can't wait to find out more about Dane next!",4,1

Both Kane and Avery shared such a beautiful life together, through good times and bad but they always had each other. I was in tears during the sad part (which i wont divulge, you have to read it to know!) Never have i done that while engrossed in a book, i've been close but never with them leaking down my face like that. I truly recommend this to any one opened minded enough to read an M/M story.

Tragedy strikes and leaves two families fighting just to have things back to normal again. Two friends travel to California, to both remember and forget.I just love Anna. I think she is one of a few of main characters that I have truly been able to relate to. Her best friend Frankie can be trying, but she totally reminded me of a friend from childhood. The boy characters were generally a little too nice and rounded for me. Love generally tended to be a little too neat, but I still got sucked in anyway.""Twenty Boys"" is a realistic look at coping with loss. Don't discount it because it has ""summer"" in its name. The book was nothing like I thought it was going to be, and that's a good thing. Take a chance on ""Boys"" and you might find a nice surprise.",4,1

The only surprise was when I hooked it up to my cable box and the back of my tv, I got a picture,  but no sound, called Cablevision, they could not figure it out, so I went to a cable forum on the internet and there was the answer, you still need the audio (RCA cables-red and white) for the audio.  The cable is HDMI to DVI, for this you need the other cables described above.  If both are HDMI, then the audio is is through the cable and you do not need the separate audio cables.  But I was able to eliminate some cables.  Not sure the picture is better than component, looks about the same.",5,1

3506407,A nice surprise!,"This book was not at all what I expected. It starts off with a tense opener -- and I almost put it down, thinking it was going to be more horror than mystery. Thankfully I held my breath for a few more sentences and met a main character that I immediately liked. If i met Mary in real life, i'd have to say she's sure got moxie. She's smart, witty, and determined, without being foul or overly bravadoed. She's got grit, but admits when she needs help, and makes appropriate decisions based on her character development.The mystery plot is well thought out and executed in a way that lets the reader sleuth along with Mary. The storyline is a straightforward whodunit, without being dark or cynical.  The supporting cast are fun, and the humor woven throughout keeps the tone pretty evenly balanced between moments of progress and tension.I certainly look forward to reading subsequent books in this series!",4,1

Brandy and Gabby get this &#8216;idea&#8217; about reconnecting their friend Lily with her high school love so she can be as happy as they are and once was.  Reading the &#8220;cover&#8221; on what the book was about didn&#8217;t give much on who the HERO would be. And it was interesting to see Lily remember a love of so long ago, but still be open to possibilities. I like that she stayed true to herself and when she opened her heart to the one she wanted to be with. I enjoyed their conversation and connection.Spoiler Alert &#8211; what I have to say I hated about this book is to learn that after the author has written 3 books for each of the ladies and their love stories, she&#8217;s going to go back and write a new book a continuation of the first &#8211; a continuation of Jason and Gabby&#8217;s story&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry but seriously?",4,1

The Monks of New Skete touch on a lot of the reasons why people choose to become caregivers for dogs; many of which people never even realize consciously.The book is also rather short, but profound and touching. The text complements the stunning photographs of dogs in various positions and actions.The only complaint I would level at the book is that for the $16.99 MSRP I had hoped for perhaps not all, but some, full color photos. The only full color photos are on the cover. All of the other photos in the book are black and white.If you know a dog lover, do them a favor and surprise them with this book. They will enjoy it almost with a doubt.",5,1

The main character is a woman stuck in a rut and not really living - just existing.  When the main issue occurs, she finally starts to reclaim herself and find a path to a productive, challenging, and enjoyable life.  There are many elements in the plot including religion, global warming, science, tradition, family relationships, and love.  Kingsolver is always excellent at descriptive imagery which I enjoy.  It is an easy read and touches upon relevant current issues.  If you enjoy her other books, you will like this one.",4,1

Paulette Harper Johnson really knows the bible, the good book of our Lord, and she has a way of writing that spoke to me.I have thought about the advice and suggestions she gives in this book, prayed the prayers she's written, and honestly, I feel better. Yes, hard times will come my way, but I know that with faith I will survive them. Completely Whole reaffirmed those beliefs.Thank you for this wonderful novel!",5,1

James tackled an extremely tough topic, child abduction and murder. At first, I wasn&#8217;t sure I could read it due to the subject matter and I feared I&#8217;d end up depressed at the end, but from page one, I couldn&#8217;t put it down. The pace was super fast. The suspense, palpable. The relationships, raw and real. James crafted perfectly placed moments for readers to breathe, find hope and even laugh&#8212;sometimes through a few tears. I loved the hope laced throughout the story and was pleasantly surprised and fascinated by a supernatural gift given to the heroine, which did not take away from the overall story or the gritty realism.I was thoroughly impressed with this book and can&#8217;t wait to see where the series goes.",5,1

The story line is a step above the norm. The suspense is top notch.Caroline is a lovely young woman struggling with her past...you will love her.  Lynn is a compassionate psychiatric nurse who cares deeply about her patients...you will admire her.  The other characters are recognizable people dealing with the everyday problems life brings.What can I say?  You will love this book!",5,1

The conduct of the hostile ""tribe"" of anthropologists is recognizable as the execrable, petty tantrums of leftist academics, and is not what one would expect of people who are confident of their own position. Chagnon's observation that these prehistoric people (Yanomamo, not anthropologists) live in a world of darkness and fear is supported by other equally unpopular works, among them 'War Before Civilization'.",5,1

I tend to order 9's when in doubt, but usually they end up too big ( which I tend to wear anyways). I decided to order the 9 in these. They do run small because this 9 fits like a glove. When I first put my feet in these, they were snug, but within about 20 minutes they loosened up to fit perfectly. I wouldn't want these too big. My feet are not slim or wide. They are just normal.  Hope this helps anyone questioning the sizes. I was so worried after reading reviews and almost didn't order these. Glad I did. So cute. Nice quality.",5,1

Its response is quick and I've had no trouble resting my hand on the ipad itself while writing.  My ONLY complaint (and it almost lost a star for this), is the size.  Could somebody (preferably BoxWave) please make a FULL SIZE stylus so it feels like a real pen in my hands???

8453088,A great story,"February and the Single Heart is a great story that follows the troubles of Mary Jo. There are so many levels to this story, and it is so well written and intriguing that you'll be pulled into Mary's world. Once you're pulled in, you'll find yourself desperate to find out if things will work out for her. It begins in a disgusting prison, and goes back to a time in her teen years when she was kidnapped and rescued by a young man. Years later, Mary must rely on this young man once again, but this time she fears if she can truly put her faith in him, or if she will be forced to spend the rest of her life in prison. An incredible read from beginning to end. I look forward to more books from this author. Their writing style was engaging and the imagery makes you feel as if you're following Mary Jo on her journey to freedom at two different times in her life. At first you aren't sure if Mary Jo is even innocent, but soon you'll be in intense suspense to find out what will happen to her.",5,1

The plot was unbelievable--like others have said would Sam and Alan really choose a room in ICU where nurses come and go all the time to discuss a murder?  I'm a nurse and as far as a patient in a coma remembering details like that is nuts.  Like others I don't know if I'll even bother reading the last book if this is the direction the author goes.",1,0

987918,Enemies are necessary,"This was a very interesting perspective.  The author sort to make the reader aware that if you are destined for greatness you will go through great trial.  Your ministry will be birthed through your pain.  What I thought was so profound was the reason for the test.  People normally say that when we are going through a test it is because God is trying to teach us a lesson.  However, the test measures what you already know.  So the teacher is silent during the test and does not allow anyone to talk to you because this is not a collaborative effort.  This forces you to focus on the test.  Wow! this is true in the natural so it follows that it would be true in the spirit also.  An enemy forces us to focus on what we know to be true.  This book was written in bite size chunks making it easy to digest.  Persecution follows prosperity so get ready.  Girt up your loins, put on the whole armour and read this book to prepare you for what is to come.",5,1

8052021,"Welcome Back, Cedar Cove!","Ah, Cedar Cove. Paris has done it again, weaving the sights, scents, and savory delights of Chesapeake Bay into a romantic novel. Not since Nora Roberts wrote her four-part series set in Maryland have I read any romances set in the same area that touched me as much. I just love the way the setting becomes another character in her novels, and I love the actual characters as well. Although Paris writes romances, she has a way of making the children in her works capture your heart as much as the hero and heroine. I'm looking forward to the third book of the series.",4,1

Cudos all around.",5,1

2342751,Paula is a party,"Where to begin?  I bought this book for my mom for her birthday and since she was out of town for a while, I decided to read it first.  Well, now I'm too embarrassed to give it to her.  Don't get me wrong, I am glad she overcame her illness and everything else she had to deal with, but some of the things she says are just filthy.Just because that's the way you talk at home or to your family doesn't mean you should put it in a book!  God! Come on.  I was raised by Southerners who didn't know the difference between good and bad grammar but I'm sure Paula knows the difference.  And another thing.  So much of the book doesn't even sound like Paula.  I think huge sections are basically her ghost writer's words because Paula's ""voice"" just isn't there.  I agree with the other posters that said to save your money.  You can get most of the story from her shows.Oh, and Paula's Party show stinks.  It is almost too painful to watch.Lucky",2,0

Her logic is solid, and her writing is hysterical. I highly recommend this book to all of my friends who are confused by the nutrition propaganda that has been clouding our views of real food for the last 60+ years. Her no nonsense approach to the real deal is refreshing in a world of nutrition lies.

The fact that one lyric which repeats over and over requires the word ""terrible"" to be pronounced wrong in order to rhyme tells you everything you need to know.

I find that an extremely attractive, and yet completely annoying, character trait.&#8221;I think I am in love with this book! The characters each have something about them that draws me to them. P.J. reminds me on me, strong willed and wanting to help others but all of the men vying for her love would be even too much for me as tempting as they each are. At times I felt like I wanted to smack one guy or another and sometimes even P.J. for her choices.  There were many surprises for me that I didn&#8217;t expect and that made the story more intriguing to me. The mild sexual content was enough to wet your appetite and well placed in the story. Nothing seemed rushed or forced. The story does hit on some touchy teen subjects to some but I feel it was tastefully done.I am itching to read the next book!",5,1

9174414,Brilliant,"One of the finest war films I've seen in many a year. Tense, moving and patiently developed. The special features are also fascinating. A little taste of a seemingly endless, frustrating, unrewarding conflict from the pov of the kids forced to sit, wait, fight and die.",5,1
8798436,Still Red Hot...,"BODY HEAT is one of those milestone movies that marks the beginning of an era. In this case, it was the Reagan 80s, filled w/ lucre and hyper-indulgence. BODY HEAT takes the beautiful film-noir of the 40s, and blends it seamlessly w/ the ""greed is good"" revolution of the I-ME-MINE decade. As Barbara Stanwyck did in DOUBLE INDEMNITY, and Lana Turner in the original THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, Kathleen Turner melts the screen w/ sexual tension and lethality. William Hurt is the perfect schmuck, lured, seduced, bagged and tagged! If you love thrillers, especially noir-thrillers, then you cannot die without having seen BODY HEAT...",5,1

From Dawkins to Harris, at the least, I have skimmed through the book or in the case of Dawkins and Hitchens read it from front to back, enjoying every page.  There's some overlap of course, it's not hard to make a case that 1)there is no god, 2) therefore the bible is a fairytale, 3)all religion is myth, etc.But this book has something new to say and from the viewpoint of a concerned observer, read it for the information on Mother Teresa alone.  Wowza, I really had no idea about her!",4,1

I'm not going to ruin things by saying what happened, but I appreciated what was wrapped up, &the; author's creativity & inspiration.I will say- again, the major flaw was in the grammar and editing (or lack thereof ), I do not appreciate reading a book that I paid for, to be assaulted almost every page by mistakes that are basic and glaring. Spellcheck is a program, not a copy editor. It makes me wish I'd checked it out instead of purchasing it&want; to offer up my services when I see great books like this foiled repeatedly by simple grammar or semantics.I'll keep buying Tara Brown's books.

After a few years of use, the tank seems to leak the fresh water onto the countertop during brewing / sometimes up to as much as 2 cups of water...Be sure that Amazon sends you the correct model..

The Hoover LINX garnered the best overall reviews, so that became my choice. The LINX is an excellent machine, it seems to pick up as well as my corded vacuums, is lightweight, stores well and is very attractive. The only negative is the longevity of the battery charge, which can be remedied by vacuuming several rooms, recharging then resuming, or by purchasing a second battery. With two batteries I can vacuum my entire 3400 sf house, including hard floors, with a little power to spare.Patsy Williams",5,1

Unfortunately, as we've seen time and again, all is not well out in the great ""rot & ruin"" and there are dangers much worse than the zombies or ""gray people."" Such as the Night Church, the followers of Thanatos, the ""reapers"" whose mission it is to cleanse the world of the remnants of humanity.

2919704,Good book for teens to read,"So often teens get this ""It won't happen to me"" syndrome and they take all kinds of chances because they are listening to the wrong voice, making stupid choices. Michelle Sutton writes what can happen if...It is a compelling story with all the drama, and yet the story asks some truly soul searching questions which any young adult must have answers to before It Happens To Them. Sutton shows that all things are possible with God which is a most excellent message for today. We really need, as a society, to quit focusing on self and start acting for the best interests of others, most especially for those we love.Good, well written story with believable characters which are well developed. Good, satisfying ending.

I like the voice feature and the fact that it incorporated both Smoke and CO detection in a single housing. The battery backup is a worthwhile feature as well,4,1

1630169,Another good read by Robb....,The In Death series is addictive. I can't wait for the next one. Concealed in Death explores the relationship among family members and the need of the older child to protect the younger members of the family.  There is less blood and more psychological thriller in this book.  It also allows the characters to speak of their own vulnerabilities.  Worth the time.,4,1

I think Picoult developed the characters well, although I was left with a couple of questions.The book did have a couple of plot twists, like most of her books, and they were clever. I enjoy trying to figure out the twists, and I found this book to be more of a challenge.If you have read and enjoyed Picoult's other novels, you will enjoy this one as well.",5,1

The only reason I have for knocking off any stars at all is that some of the childhood stories are a bit hard to follow as to whose childhood they were.This was suggested as a book club book, and I'm glad it was-- this story is engaging and well written. I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the topic of gender representation in American society.",4,1

But this is nothing like his other stuff except maybe ""Recordings"" 2001, a CD I also discarded, or ""Voyage 34"" track 4 - 1993.I cant get stoned enough to agree with any favorable reviews.  So I'm just saying be aware!BTW - when this review of mine gets o out of 100 ""helpful"" it means 0 out of 100 don't ""agree"", that isn't the same as helpful, Steve Wilson reminds me of the Beatles as far as talent goes and I'm just saying this CD is NOT the Steve I know and love.DVD disc is 5.1 audio - no actual video",1,0

If there was a way to give it zero stars I would have done that.  The mother was just awful to her daughters and the fairy tale excruciating to read. The characters were all so unlikeable, the story was boring and the book made me so angry that I continued to read it.  I should have my head examined for reading ""Night Road"" some time afterwards since it is also on my list of worst books. It was completely predictable right from the start and it was most likely the last book of hers I will read since it is obvious that many people can't be trusted with their reviews.  I think she ought to retire from writing or just write little stories for magazines since these were just long, very drawn out magazine quality articles.",1,0

My feelings are complicated by having a 20-something son in the military aviation due to support soldiers leaving Afghanistan in 2014.

1100399,This Deserves Ten Stars,"Other reviews have said what needs to be said about a book I quite simply could not put down. I started it early this morning, and fortunately I was able to put off doing the cleaning, the grocery shopping--everything--just because this book is probably one of the best I have ever read, and I am a voracious reader. Told from the point of view of five people and set, as are Rash books in the Carolinas, it is a story that will challenge the reader's values--is there ever a cause to murder someone? The novel is written with such poignant language. I truly do not know why this did not receive a Pulitzer.",5,1

1855569,Firespell,"This is the first book in the Dark Elite series and I thoroughly enjoyed it! A quick read and while a little fluffy, I liked the interaction between the characters; however, I would love to get some more in depth background on some of the characters. I think that the moral of the story are very clear, but definitely a black and white world that the Adepts have chosen to espouse. I especially liked Scout and Lily's friendship and Lily's easy acceptance of what is really going on at St. Sophia's. The only question is...will Lily come through the ordeals she must face as she was...or will it change her life forever? Pick up Firespell and find out!!Dark Elite Series: Firespell (1), Hexbound (2), Charmfall (3)",5,1

4547292,Big Bad Apple.........,I am a fan of Nisa Santiago and even though this story was good it was not my favorite. I loved the story and the plot but somethings just pissed me off. One part made me sad but the hatred between sisters really got on my nerves at times. Nisa knows how to capture you in her books and she definetly did that again in this book but it was just something that I could not put my finger own. I waited until Coca Kola came out before I bought both books. I am reading Coca Kola and so far so good. I will continue to be a fan of Nisa Santiago's and her work.,4,1

She goes into great detail about all her writing methods and the do's and don't's of a good writer.",5,1
4262034,Very interesting book.,"I have read other books about Katherine Hepburn, but this one had a unique point of view: what can we learn from looking at KH's life and her personality? I think the author took a realistic look at Hepburn. She clearly showed Hepburn's many strengths and the lessons that can be learned from those strengths. But she did not paint Hepburn as perfect. The author showed Hepburn's stubborn side and her tendency to use denial throughout her life to maintain an idealized version of the truth. The author was also very realistic about the Hepburn-Tracy love affair and presented that relationship in a different light than other books/articles I've read. As a long-time KH fan, I loved getting a sense of what Hepburn was really like as a person and friend. This book did not focus on the typical Hollywood hype about a mega-star's glamorous life. It was a fun, interesting and easy read. Very enjoyable and at times thought-provoking.",4,1

I'm really not into witches but I gave it a try and in the end it was a decision that I was happy that I made. I was blown away of how Lotempio gave me a good picture of the book. It was an easy read for a book with so much information to remember. There was never a dull moment throughout the book. Though I though Morgan was somewhat whiny and negative throughout the story but a still good female heroine.I am definitely hungry for more. If Lotempio would make another book, I would definitely read it. And maybe because of this book - I'll venture to reading books with witches.",4,1

6947199,"Used with a Nintendo Wii--so-so usability, but GREAT picture!","I purchased a different converter to get component signals to a VGA computer monitor, and bought this unit after that one failed. I wish I had discovered this one sooner!First, this product appears well made (heavy metal), and it WORKED right out of the box with no fidgeting. In addition, the colors and sharpness were NOTICEABLY better than a competitors product--even my wife noticed. Also, it passes audio like it should (another unit I had failed to pass stereo correctly), and doesn't run hot or anything.The only downside is that this unit is always passing a signal, so your monitor will never shut-off automatically, even if your Wii (or other output device) is off. Also, this unit will turn itself off after awhile, so you have to leave it out so you can turn it back on manually the next time you want to use your Wii (or other device).So, the usability could definitely be improved, but until the Wii U comes out with high-def output, this box definitely does the trick.",4,1

8898829,Blu Ray Quality is superb,"This was one of my first Blu Ray discs. In fact, I bought a Blu Ray player because I wanted this movie on Blu Ray.I was not disapointed in the quality of the print of the sound at all.As for the movie, this is the 2nd best superhero movie ever made. It is second only to The Dark Night, the 2nd movie in this trilogy.It shows a darker Batman than you saw in the Michael Keaton version. (Though that version will always hold a special place in my heart). This movie makes all the Batman gadets and his stroy line almost plausible, rather than the comic book version Michael Keton was in. That gives the whole film a much more realsistic and immersive experience. (I'm not even going to compare this to the Val Kilmer / George Clooney festivals of awfulness).",5,1

If you really love music and you have the money, I'd suggest moving up to the z523 or the big daddy, the Z2300 (still lusting over them!) but if you're tight on budget or just like to be realistic with your purchases, this is definitely the system to get.

Cause this album isn't that, it's classic early 90's music that's been slept on a bit.  This is when Acey was still sounded like normal a normal emcee and not all avante garde(?).  The rhyming isn't the best, but their delivery stands alone in my mind.  It goes with the music perfectly.  And the music goes with the lyrics in the same way.  It's got some normal tracks as well as some live instruments.

722579,unsubtle biased language ruins credibility,"This book reads like a tabloid, and it's hard to consider it could be more than just that.Not only are sources not quoted in a scientific historical way, but the book also rests heavily on the use of unsubtle  biased language against Hoover. I do not doubt that Hoover used illegal  means for his person goals, but I would much rather have read a book that  gives me the feeling I should take it seriously, because it shows on every  page and footnote it takes itself and its investigation serious. This  unbalanced account of his life has flipped over to one side, proclaiming  Hoover the bad guy, without exploring even the possiblilty of a positive  side of the man. It's as if the writer settles a scoure here. It left me  with the uneasy feeling I do not know WHAT to believe and what to  discard.If you like a good scandal, this is your book. If you want  historical facts, look elsewhere",1,0
469666,Fast Paced Adventure,"Barracuda 945 by Patrick Robinson is a fun, well-written, fast paced adventure novel. I have read several of Mr. Robinson's books and this is one of his best. The plot flows well for a ""quick read"" military fiction book. A new nemesis for Admiral Morgan is introduced in the body of the SAS Major Kerman turned Hamas terrorist leader. I am currently reading Scimitar SL-2, which generally takes up where Barracuda 945 left off and does so very well so far. Mr. Robinson writes good miltary fiction on a world-wide scale dealing mostly with submarines and Seals, with a few picks, and justifyably so, at a couple of past liberal Presidents who let our military down along the way. Some of the plots may be a little ""imaginative"" but they make for interesting stories and characters, and just a good, fun read for the military fiction fan.",5,1

So many artist and just a handful can get the characters right.  Sometimes the drawings are good but the coloring is too shining.  Anyway, I topok a star out because of the screwy art.This hardcover edition doesn't give you anything new nor cool, and the art make it non-worthy of having it in cool hardbound.  Without the dustjacket the book is very simple.  Nothing fancy, and because of that I recomend you to save your money and get the sofcover edition instead.",4,1

I met some of the 101st during my own military days, actually when I was on Okinawa and was impressed by their demeanor.......their total professionalism and dedication....What an amazing group they were and still are.

9422119,"""The Comedy"" it is not.","This film appears to be about a psychopath who lives life only through the live scenarios he creates using other people in order to gratify his limited being.  He is bored and his scenarios are pointless to viewers with more normal real minds.  Because of this, the entire film is probably viewed by most as pointless unless one has some sort of interest in the filmmakers' view of their character's deviate behavior.  But since this behavior is created by the filmmakers, it is not real, and could only possibly provide limited insight into their minds and motives for making such a film.  Much of the film is sick because it merely reflects the sickness of the psychopathic main character.  I do not think it can be called a character study because no character exists to study outside of the filmmakers' imagination.  I could not even assess the quality of acting because I would not know how such a character should behave.  Accordingly, I cannot find a reason to recommend this film to anyone.",1,0

4078135,Mark Waid should go to hell for this.,"Kingdom Come was one of the best stories ever and had the potential for a lot of great follow ups but is completely ruined by the Kingdom. Why did Mark Waid think that this was the way to follow up Kingdom Come? There were too many mistakes here to be believed, the story was bad, the art was bad, and all it served was to create a plot device that completely undo's Crisis and is sure to be an even bigger mistake in the future. It also screws up Alex Ross's character designs. Batman doesn't wear his helmet in the final part, why do we want to see an old man in Bat-armor. The Flash's look is reduced to the regular custume with Jay Garrick's Helmet (why, why, why!!!?).  In it's defense the filler stories showcasing the Kingdom Come characters decent, enjoyable stories with good art exploring the Kingdom Come future, which is what a KC sequel should have been about. But these aren't enough to forgive Waid and to ever just his writing again.",2,0
5577708,Great finish!!,Another top read from this author.

The Lovers Live disc has no contributions to this disc.  If you're a new fan it gives you a good sample of Sade.  It will make you buy each separate disc individually, because she has a great sound.  Everyone today sounds like her.  She is the standard.  New fan, buy this disc.  It will make you want every song she has done.",5,1

2651211,Excellent first effort,"Having been a James Lee Burke fan for quite some time, I fully expected to find an intriguing tale, but with JLB overtones. Not at all. Judgement Calls is fast-paced, immediately engaging and definitely the author's own. The dialog is realistic, sharp and often very funny. Burke's Samantha Kincaid is well drawn, an imperfect, thoroughly likable, bright Assistant District Attorney with minor emotional baggage (no angst) and an attitude to which any woman can relate. The other characters are better than adequate; not as detailed as one might like, but their motivations are clearly understood. The story is a gut-wrencher for anyone with teens (and Burke gets the teen attitude down to the rolling-eye sighs!). The story is a little convoluted, perhaps because of the legal details, but it pulls you in and by the end you've got it. I'm glad I started this book on Friday evening, because I was up all night finishing it!",5,1

Needless to say such actions would ultimately bring these groups to conflict, but amazingly it took a full 56 years to do so!

2903607,Falls into the Snow Crash trap,"This book starts out strong, with an interesting premise -- a man finds himself in an unfamiliar place, with no memory of what came before. Eventually he comes to realize he's in a virtual world... and struggles to find his true identity.However, halfway through the book the narrative takes on a preachy note as the theme turns to God's love and His plan for our lives. While not explicitly Christian -- the name of Jesus is never mentioned -- that's the vibe it gives.It reminds me very much of Neal Stephenson's ""Snow Crash"" in that regard. While I think ""Snow Crash"" is a classic, Stephenson lost me in the second half of the book when he started delving into the Sumerian mythology. ""Vrin"" left the same sort of taste in my mouth.",2,0

520646,I &lt;3 Rachel Morgan!,"Another amazing book by Kim Harrison! Rachel Morgan is one of the most fabulous protagonists I have read about in a while. She is a smart, sassy redhead who's not afraid to kick butt. I think what I love most about her character is her versatility. She fights bad guys with super awesome demon-earth magic, martial arts combat skills, and her quick wits. Most of the time, her plans don't work out the way she wants them too, but she always manages to save the day in the end...sort of. There were a lot of surprises at this book which were definitely completely unexpected. I can't wait to read the next one and see what new twists the author will throw at us!",5,1

No chance now, because of the lack of content in the blu ray version. First, the episodes aren't the uncut versions. It looks like they are the the episodes that aired on tv almost 20 years ago. I expected more and got way less than what I had from a set of dvd's about 10 years old now.",1,0

5697129,tthe beginning of some classic musicians,This such a wonderful album the beginning of Stills and Young both wrote most of the songs some great songs that would become some classic songs of the time. I first picked this up when it came out I think I may have heard For What It's Worth and this was one of my favorite groups at the time. Like many people I would continue to follow their guys in the many groups that would grow from this group. Think about Stills and Young both playing lead singing and writing in the same group. Some wonderful singing on this one but then these guys went on to be with some of the best vocal groups of our time. This is such a wonderful album I forget just how great this album is. Sad that we only have the three albums from these guys.,5,1

511768,"Impossible to please everyone, but a good read!","An earlier reviewer incoherently castigated Bryson for not explaining why Shakespeare was great. I could say, rightly, that that reader missed the whole point of Bryson's book. Also, I don't think Bryson is the right person to write about why Shakespeare wrote what he wrote. There are scholars who have done, and will do, nothing but.  Face it, this book will not satisfy everyone, but anyone who can appreciate Bryson's witty approach will surely enjoy this.  The book summarizes what is known about Shakespeare's life and his world and manages to wrap in a good deal of infomation on speculations about the Bard's ""true"" identity.  I think that Bryson has done a great job.",4,1
8425765,Love this Book,"As always, Elizabeth Lennox has delivered. I got so wrapped up in the latest Thorpe family installment that I blocked out everything else and just read. It was fun seeing how these two loved one another from afar but were cautious about building a relationship outside of the office. Seeing a man with strong family support, one who steps out to provide what his lady needs (think shoes) was nice. I definitely recommend this book and again; the only reason it does not get a full five stars is due to errors where it looks like spell/grammar check accepted the spelling but the word was wrong. Proof reading is an important job in writing anything. The heroine should not become her sexy skirts and make-up and his muscles should be hard not lard. These are just a couple of the mistakes I found. Read, enjoy, skim over the poor choices in wording. This was the first of the Thorpe books for me. I am now going ignore everything here again and begin reading another.",4,1

Over and over I have found myself saying ""how does she think of this stuff"" or something like it. She has created a unique story and  world that I continue to explore and will follow until the end.

813176,A Great Giver-Like Novel,"This book is basically set in the same world as the Giver.  The society controls what you do for a career, who you will marry, etc. The main character, Cassia, is matched with her best friend, Xander.  But as the novel progresses, she realizes that she has feelings for a society outcast, Ky.  And as you can guess, a love triangle develops.This is the first book in the trilogy, and is a great book to set up the world and the characters.  If you like dystopian novels, especially the Giver, I recommend reading this trilogy.  It is good all the way until the end.",5,1
8490370,If You Only Knew #1,OMG!!!!! If only I could just copy and paste Nicola Haken's review. I feel the exact same way. This story is not for the hypocritical people that think marriage is a lasting thing. So many will read this and feel as if the author is writing about them. My emotions were at an all time high. A MUST READ!!!!!,5,1

7541168,Wonderful.  Personal preference is secondary to air popper.,"Best alternative to an air popper for when you can't use one.  This is certainly by runner up, backup, choice.  This can burn the popcorn if you don't take it out in time and the popcorn tastes slightly better from an air popper because it doesn't steam the popcorn after it's been cooked like this does.A good bonus to this over an air popper is that it's really easy to add your salt, kernels, and oil/butter all at once before you even pop it.  It coasts it as evenly as possible, something you can't achieve at all with air-popped.",5,1
2103415,Not bad,This is a decent read. There is a decent story and the author writes it in a interesting way. You get some juicy details at the start that compel you to keep turning pages. I was not sold on a couple of the character interactions but but that's easy to overlook. Some of the info on organ transplants is inaccurate like the doc knowing when a transplant would be available. This is not a medical thriller so I didn't expect total accuracy. All in all I'd recommend this book. It was entertaining and well written. I'll look for more books by Andy Holloman in the future.,4,1

I certainly dont need to critique the artist since I assume those reviewing on this thread are fans. I can only conclude that some so-called fans will never be happy and need an outlet for the ""glass-half full"" reviews!",5,1
4967203,Good story except...,"The author needs help with the last book of the Bible. As commonly misqouted, the last book is Revelation, not Revelations. Someone in editing should have caught that. It was blatantly wrong. Also, it's a bit too &#34;super human&#34; in a couple of spots. I also noticed that the description of the Suderium of Ovieto sounded suspiciously like the wikipedia decsription. In spite of this, I enjoyed the story.",4,1

1066986,Just superb,"I read this book in one day ignoring my husband and 4 month old baby in the process.  I felt guilty afterwards and spent the next 2 days being overly attentive.  But, I just could not put this book down.  The story line is great with enough drama, twists and of course the sensuous romance that Ms. Jackson is known for.  The book spans over 30 years and is divided into 3 parts.  I fell in love with Jenna and Randolph as well as Leigh and Noah; and loved to hate Angela.  Ms. Jackson you have outdone yourself and I can't wait to read more of your mainstream novels.  Keep up the good work",5,1

The extra footage around the making of the film, especially the original, was very exciting (and there is A LOT of extra behind-the-scenes info to know about). I also really like the packaging, it's well made and slim enough to fit nicely on any media shelf. As for the movies, 1 & 2 are my favorites (I'm pretty sure I can recite Aliens by heart) but it was more cost effective to have the whole set. And this way I get to give the last two a few more views. There wasn't a behind-the-scenes on the 4th one, which I thought was interesting, but this is a product that delivers and at an amazing sale price for blu-ray!",5,1

8455062,Good Advice For Workaholics,The author breaks down the reasons why you might be a workaholic and it is good information to know. Many people are in denial about being workaholics or they just don't know any other way of life. There are questions throughout the book that give you time to reflect on whether or not you have the signs of being a workaholic. Overall this is a good read for people who struggle with workaholism.,4,1

8849552,A simple yet intriguing film.,"After watching Tigerland, you wonder how did Joel Schumacher manage to direct such a simple yet intriguing film after that horrible Batman &amp; Robin? This film is about the loyalty, integrity, fear and hope of men. I believe that the Vietnam War is simply used as a backdrop. This is an intense, psychological film. The plot isn't that great, but it's what Bozz's character that helps this film a very emotional piece. I'd say Colin Farrell is the next Mel Gibson, if not probably even better. After watching this film, there's something about it that makes you feel good, and you wanna enlist yourself to war. A must-see for all.",4,1
4120261,"If you read only one book on World War I, make it this one.","Richard Holmes has written a no-nonsense concise guide to both World War I  and the controversial historiography that has dogged the conflict ever  since. He summarizes the events of the Western Front (only--other theaters  are mentioned only as they impact Germany's decisions about force  allocation) quickly, perhaps too quickly for my taste. He slows down a  little bit when reviewing the major controversies from the war over  tactics, strategy, and war guilt, where he examines the different schools  of thought with an even hand. Sometimes his hand is too even: on some  topics, particularly when discussing the question of why trench warfare  degenerated into such bloody, futile slaughter, I wanted Holmes to be  bolder in naming names.But these are petty disagreements with what is a  very successful attempt to summarize the events on the Western Front. I  hope Holmes will someday give other theaters similar treatment.",5,1
3582360,Beautiful Love Story,"Wow! I just finished this and couldn't wait to recommend it! This is a love story that doesn't revolve around 20 somethings and their first love. As a woman in her late 30's it is so refreshing to read a love story that while it does sweep you away, it also deals with real life relationship issues. The scenery is breathtaking as is the romance, but the love scenes.......wooooowee they are hot! This story has such a great balance of romantic love as well as sensual lovemaking. I can't wait to read more from this author.",5,1

3586080,False Advertising,"I adore well written vampire romantic suspense. This is not. The description and reviews led me to believe otherwise. Vampires equal sex. I know and expect that. But this book is one page of storyline followed by ten or so of very explicit sex scene. Or should I better say porn? This should be identified as erotica. Good luck to the parents of teens who flock to the vampire fantasy. This will educate them in matters for which they are just not prepared. I'm very disappointed. I thought I had found a promising new vampire series to while away my evenings and bought this as an introduction to the main characters in the full length novels. Needless to say, I will not be reading those.",1,0

Get your allocation right, buy appropriate index funds, rebalance as markets and your life situation require and stop trying to have the ""hope"" that your active managed funds will beat their benchmarks over long time periods seem to be the message here.

629925,Heartfelt exploration of counterintuitive motivation,"In this sequel to his bestseller, Predictably Irrational, Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics, returns to the how and why of human beings' inexplicable thought processes. Through a series of telling, small-scale social experiments, he attempts to quantify such unquantifiables as how satisfaction in work becomes nourished or destroyed, how people value their attractiveness and the attractiveness of others, how humans adapt to adverse or positive circumstances, and how to make pleasure more enduring and annoyances less upsetting. Those who read Ariely's first book might have the context to better appreciate this one, but he doesn't seem to hold anything back as he explains his traumatic physical injuries and the lessons, both painful and joyous, those experiences wrought. The author's warm, direct, compassionate tone, and his willingness to share his frustrations and discoveries, lead getAbstract to recommend this insightful, easy-going tour of the irrational side of the human psyche.",5,1

Lots and lots of twists and turns, lots of fake outs and lots of super duper secret agent stuff.  If you love a good mystery and love a good spy story, this one will fill the bill.  Tim Stevens has done a masterful job of developing the characters and making you like even the bad guys a little bit.  Not all the heroes live, not all the bad guys die.  Definitely going to get the other three in this series and then go after the rest of his work.  Couldn't put it down.",5,1
830589,A very readable and fascinating book about brain research,"I have been intellectually enthralled by this book, which describes case studies and research about our brain's amazing capacity for change, growth and adaptation.  So many books about the brain quickly become tedious reading to the non-neuroscientist, but this one continued to keep my interest and curiosity through every chapter.  I have recommended it to everyone I know who has even a mild interest in how the brain works.  So much of what I learned about the brain back in college is so obsolete and often wrong, so this was an important update for me.  This book offers a great deal of hope to people with brain-related disorders and injuries -- and normal aging.  I cannot recommend it highly enough!",5,1

6347582,Nice,These slippers are very nice.  I think this style is true to size.  Other Daniel Green slippers are a little small.  The only issue I would say that I have is that the Ruby color led me to believe they would be more red than  burgundy.  That is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

4198145,Another Cute Super-Heroine Series,"I really don't know what made me want to pick this series up.  Normally, any shogou manga never strikes me as something I want to buy, but perhaps the cat girl on the cover had something to do with my interest...Anyway, the series is your standard super-girl style storyline with the interesting charateristic that instead of simply using a transformation amulet to put on a sailor suit, they instead change into animals (albiet in an extremely low key way).  All in all this part of the series is standard, however, what I beleive this series has is a very interesting plot-line that evolves from the characters having animal DNA in their system and no longer being truly human.  Its a very nice catch.  There is an anime for this in Japan currently, and is being released in fansubs.

8282001,Loved It,"Belle Aurora has done it again. I loved this story. It has every emotion you can think of; laughter, fear, anger, sadness, empathy, love, joy.  Asher has such an awful childhood and when he meets Natalie he meets his match.  She helps him with all of his demons and he slowly but surely falls in love with her.  So much to get over and in the end they have their HEA.  Loved Asher &#34;Ghost&#34; Collins and Natalie &#34;Nat&#34; Kovac.  This was the 2nd book for this series and I liked better than the first one.  Next up is Max's story and that should be just as good.  Thank you Belle, you're awesome.",5,1
6998773,Excellent mouse; no significant complaints so far,"The Good:* Excellent layout; fits nicely in my hand.* Linux compatible (though with some caveats for the Unified Receiver - see &#34;The Ugly&#34; below)The Bad:( No complaints! )The Ugly:* The trackball is a little bit resistant to movement, more so than other trackball mice I've used.  However, this does make it a bit easier to control the mouse without the cursor flying around.* Logitech doesn't offer Unified Receiver software for Linux, so if you're a Linux user, you'll need a third-party package.  I'm currently using ltunify, but Solaar should also work.  Both are available on most distros' repositories.",5,1
5379641,riveting,"I always love reading a book that discusses a topic in a slightly different way. Cathy Glass's stories of children she has fostered nearly always touch on the tragedy of abuse whether sexual or physical or emotional. This story explores abuse of a much more insidious nature that is not immediately apparent but when it becomes obvious and explained it is quite horrifying and just as damaging and difficult for the little girl to recover from. This is also a story of the sometimes redemptive power of good therapy and therapists to enable a father and daughter to be reunited and to raise understanding that sometimes reunification is possible and people can turn their lives around and address the underlying issues that led them to become unfit for parenting at one time. I found this book engrossing, riveting, disturbing, enlightening and ultimately heart lifting.",5,1
4266995,Return of Imaro,"The beginning of this collection of excellent short stories begins just after the end of the first book. Imaro is in pursuit of the kidnapper of Tanisha when... well, that would be telling and I would not want to do that.The book is very well written and Charles Saunders love and affection for the characters and setting and the genre itself all shine through. He admits to editing and rewriting parts of the stories included in this book to make them fit the story arch that he had in mind., Having never read the original stories themselves I cannot compare the two. However in this book it works well and it really does form a effective and engaging story line.If you enjoy Sword and Sorcery fiction or even if you are looking for a fantasy story set in a mythical Africa then this book may be just what you are looking for.",5,1
6794232,He thought it was great,I bought this for my Grandson for his birthday.  He wanted to replace his stock Ford P/U speakers.  I decided on these after reviewing the specs of competitors within the price range.  Infinity out-performed the others.  Apparently it was a good choice as he is very satisfied with the sound quality.  I read reviews that stated the bass was not low enough but he is happy with them and has no desire for a sub-woofer to supplement the quality.,5,1

While there isn't anything really new that hasn't been covered before, the book is a good compliment to others previously published on the Earhart story. The focus on (mis)communications highlights the thread of errors that lead to the tragedy. The inclusion of the disc (a nice touch!) containing the source data allows the reader to draw their own conclusions.",4,1

Don't know how to better say it than that.  The ideas expressed in the man - machine interface were beautifully descriptive and accurate.  My work background has been in computer user interface and the author has done his research and described it well.The description of Amish life, culture and thought processes and the interplay of ideas between the world view of the 'English' and the Amish was insightful.  The conflicts of the main characters romance was enjoyable to consider.  The plot, with its twists and turns kept me wanting for more. I hope that there is a sequel in the future.Thoroughly enjoyable.  Well done Mr. Bunker!",5,1

One of my favorite aspects of the Mantis is how it folds to a compact size for travel.  It can be shaped in a variety of fashions to best suit the filming environment/filming equipment.  I typically use two handles with an over-the-shoulder piece but have also formed it into a cage-like shape, for filming sweeping shots with the camera low to the ground.",5,1

I find it very cheap of them to charge $50-$60 for a tiny little chip, but fail to include a case that only cost them pennies. I like to use a sharpie to write on the case noting what is on that particular card.  You can't really write on the card itself.  Then I store them in a zippered wallet.  The only cases I could find locally were connected to each other making it impossible to put into my storage wallet.  I had checked all of the office supply stores, electronic stores, and discount chains -without luck- before I thought of Amazon.  Anyway, I bought 10-pack of these and now I have a few extras on hand for future cards.",5,1

And then they found them again at the lodge in the poachers bag.  When they found them the other baby that had not been stolen was already grown and when this book finished the baby that was already grown went back to Sam's mountain and looked for a mate.  It was really interesting because I got to learn something about birds.  I think kids 8 and up should read this book to know something about birds.",5,1

2208430,Good novel written by the Ghostwriter,"After learning that this novel is not based on any notes left by the late Virgina C. Andrews but solely is the ghostwriter's novel alone, it makes what came after this series and the Landry series as well, a let down, having seen how badly he has done by recopying what was in the Cutler series into the new Hudson series.  But this is a pretty good novel. Will hold your attention from page one until the final end although, like with Darkest Hour, everything seems rushed to a fast conculsion. But otherwise, it's a decent novel.",5,1

5756943,ATLANTIC MUST HAVE RELEASED THIS JUST TO FILL A VOID FOR THOSE WHO JUST HAD TO HAVE A NEW ARETHA ALBUM,"We ALL must agree Aretha was on a Serious Roll during this time...Her Singles were going #1 and/or Top Ten on Billboard, And ALL of her Albums were flying off the shelves! So why not release a Live Album??? Almost every company has done this either too soon or too late. In this case too soon. There was no Unreleased or Never-Heard-Before-Songs (Not even one!), So for those who already had her First Four Atlantic albums wasn't in a hurry to go grab this one. The backing band is so-so, as always her vocals shine throughout....But must of us was waiting for the next Studio Project or even another 'Live' that was worth talking about (Later we got the ""Live At Fillmore West"" project that was worth talking about!!!). So just to add to your collection for the purpose of saying ""I Own It""...get it, but to go the 'Extra mile' looking for it....That's another story.",4,1
5301323,Absolutely adorable!,"What a brilliant little book. The artwork was amazing. So vivid and colorful. And the story was brilliant, chock full of adventure and fun, all put to rhyme. Even possessing an allegory or two, though cleverly subtle.I read this with my six-year-old and she was just as mesmerized as I was, the two of us really bonded over reading it. In fact, as she is just learning to read herself, she pointed out the words she knew while following along.This is the second book we've read together of Pat Hat's and I must say that each one is more impressive than the last. This author makes reading fun, which is exactly how children's books should be, especially when used as a means to draw our children into a lifetime love affair with reading. I believe that this author has honed just that level of story-telling.Great stuff. I highly recommend it!",5,1

480438,"Good, but definitely more emphasis on character","This book was good, starting enough after Sabriel left off to be less of a continuance of that story. Unfortunately, this story ends right as the plot begins to take off.  I really enjoyed the descriptions of the characters, though, and there is definitely a twist.  Also, Nix brings charter magic more into the story than he did in Sabriel, so that was exciting.  The book isn't boring, though it becomes frustrating at times because of the slowness or the fact that you want to read more about Lirael.  I couldn't put it down, but I desperately wanted to start reading the sequel to it, so if you're one of those people who get into a story and won't rest until the story is done, wait until Nix writes the next one, because this story has no real ending, just a ""Sorry folks, but that's all we have for today"" type thing.  And that was the most frustrating of all.",5,1
8775405,"GREAT FILM, BUT HORRENDOUS TRANSFER TO DVD","&quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; is one of the best of the 1930's Screwball comedies, hence the high rating. It would have gotten five stars, but the  DVD is taken from an incomplete dupe. The results are, to say the least,  virtually unwatchable. Hope is on the horizon; Universal has struck new  35mm prints from the original negative, and it's playing right here in  Philly. Hopefully, after the cinema reissue, Universal Studios wil finally  do right by this movie and release a pristine DVD(and VHS for those who  still only have that).",4,1

2413045,It'll improve your Multiplayer Quake Frags,"This book delivers exactly what the title indicates.  US Officer Lester Grau interviews many Afghan Mujahideen who fought the Soviet Aggressors during the early 80's.  Out of those interviews Grau wrote three books, This one being the second (with Ahmed Jalali.)The book is broken into chapters like Raids, Ambushes, Defense etc... Each chapter has many individual ""stories"" or debriefings of the mission/situation.  The Muj go into detail on what happened, who got shot and who didn't.  As you progress through the 200 odd missions, you start reading a definite character to the overall war...All in all, as a non-military person, I found the book fascinating, entertaining, and above all educational.  The diagrams for each mission are very helpful allowing the reader to visualize what happens in each battle.Overall, If you are interested in Guerilla or Afghan warfare tactics, I would recommend this book.",5,1

Nothing here is rocket science, just simple, straightforward tips on topics such as working, and treating others how you want to be treated yourself; often this comes down to just plain and simple manners - sadly lacking with some.A good book, clear and easy to read. If you think you could benefit from some simple tips, then this books is worth it.Thanks Alicia.",5,1

3343520,"Swords and Sorcery, Fantasy and Horror","Characters:  Author does a good job of character creation, adequate motivation for future actions, actors stay in character.Plot:  Basic, but well-done.  There's a certain satisfaction in recognizing a familiar plot, and a lot of enjoyment when it's handled well, by a good writer, as is done here.Settings:  Settings also well-done.  The reader can practically see the white breaths in the cold, hear the crackle of dry snow under the feet.A bit too much horror for my taste, but that's just a personal preference.Unlike so many recent authors, the story spends its reader's time unrolling the plot, revealing the actors and the actions, delineating the surroundings WITHOUT padding the book with page after page of endless descriptions of minutiae, as has become so fashionable in the last few years, creating 500- and 600- page monstrosities.

505861,God's grace at work through a humble man,"&quot;Just as I am&quot; reveals the grace of God, illustrated by the life of Billy Graham.  Graham is refreshingly honest and humble about his life's purpose and God's will. His life is evidence of what a human is capable of if he/she lets God take control.It's an amazing testimony of one man's journey from a humble farm boy to an international preacher. As a political science nut I was fascinated by his interactions with so many US Presidents. Billy Graham has truly influenced the path of our nation, and therefore, the world.Yet this book is careful to point out that his success is not due to Billy Graham, but God working through Graham's life.  Everyone who reads this book must consider the &quot;Hour of Decision.&quot;  Billy Graham's testimony demands that apathy is not a choice in the decision regarding eternity.",5,1

1910548,A Different Approach,"Very often, books written by Nobel laureates in physics tend to overindulge in arcane philosophical arguments. Some topics discussed are so far removed from the average scientist's day-to-day reality to the point of being comparable to someone's unrealistic abstract nightmare. However, this book is quite different. The author remains grounded and presents his science as something much more tangible. Although some philosophizing is unavoidable, there are also various anecdotes that add a nice personal touch. The writing style is engaging and the topics are varied - within the realm of physics and physicists. I would recommend this book mainly to scientists and science buffs.",4,1

You can feel her excitement and fear. The adventures,troubles and Molly's unique personality make for a great story and you can't wait to see what happens next. Beginning friendships, murder, political corruption, betrayals and finding your way in a new country, this story has that and more. I can't wait to see what Molly does next.",5,1

I taped the CD from a friend that had it, but eventually  grew so attached to it that I had to go and buy the CD myself.  It is a  great album for guitar lovers and for those who like reflective lyrics with  a touch of angst.  There is a tiny sliver of punk in the mix here in the  singer's voice and the edginess of the guitars - just enough to keep it  from being relegated to the dreaded 'pop' status.  For those who are  looking for Big Buzzy Guitar, pick up Human Cannonball, which is more  in-your-face, but still a great collection of melody and lyric genius.  Both are well produced and recorded which helps them get better with every  listen.",5,1

I turned on both the TV and the TB110MW9A and switched the TV to channel 3.Things seemed to have gone OK while the TB110MW9A went through initial setup, including scanning. But then, it started switching off the RF output (resulting in total ""snow"" noise on TV) in random intervals (every 30 seconds or so), for about 15 seconds or so, then switch RF back on.This, of course, was not very usable. I decided to try the second box and... it exhibited the same problem.I RMA-ed the boxes to Magnavox for repair/replacement. It took them more than 3 months to return... a different model! (RTB100MW9). To me that smells like a design flaw... Stay away from this model (TB110MW9A).",1,0
7476633,Great Ultrabook at a Very Reasonable Price,"I've had my S7 now for about two weeks, and I can confidently say that I've never had a nicer computer. It boots up from being completely off in under 10 seconds. It's fast and responsive. It's powerful enough to run games, but efficient enough to last a day at work.I need a computer for my job, and this does fantastic work. All of my programs run very well, and I can get a full work day in on the battery. The trackpad is responsive, and I can't get enough of the touch screen. The S7 is also incredibly thin and light. I'm coming from a 2006 Macbook Pro, which I thought was very portable, but this is off the scale, especially for a PC.",5,1
5795797,Perfect melodic pop ignored,"I found this CD in a bargain bin for 2.50 after hearing the song &quot;Empty Ships&quot; on a late-night specialty show. I was shocked to discover that the rest of the album was even more promising.  It's too sad  that none of these songs were released as singles, this band deserves alot  more credit.  There are two lead singers with two totally diffent styles.  One creates a beautiful pop sound and the other a more mellow atmospheric  sound.  Nonetheless the music created here contains an element that only a  truly talented band could showcase.",5,1

I reserve 5 stars for the best of the best. Outlander gets 5. In reality, ABOSAA should be perhaps a 4.5. Whatever, I loved it. I think every other follower of the Jamie/Claire adventures will, also. Diana is back in form.",4,1
6258459,Not really worth the money,Bought two of these for the summer as I work out and swim a lot.  Decent quality but they are the low end of the Champion line.  Like another reviewer mentioned they almost sheer when held up to the light.  There is no inner liner and the material is thin.  I also don't like that the draw string is made into a loop instead of two formed ends like the ends of a shoe string.  I had to cut mine and I'm sure they will fray.Due to the thinness of the material I'm not sure I want to swim in these?  Better deals out there for sure.  Walmart sells Starter gear for 10-12 dollars.  Much better stuff.,2,0

I can't say much more about the storyline without giving it away except, of course, that it has a happy ending.  This movie is in no ways hard SF, and those looking for it will not like the movie.

I continually draw insight into my own life and how I approach the world through his works.  We are all on 'The Hero's Journey' and it is when we hear and accept the call that we begin to truly become alive.Campbell may have started as the foremost authority on the myths of the world, but he ended as one of America's most insightful philosophers on what it is to be alive.  If you have never read Campbell, you must.  I also recommend the audio of The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers.",5,1
1732043,Stuart Hill's Awesome Adventure,"Very few books have me ready to give 6 stars if that were possible, but this quite lovely book does just that.  Though slightly formulaic, Cry of the Icemark has endearing characters, excellent dialogue, and descriptions that wash over the senses with ease without describing every rock and bug in the Icemark.  I'll be the first to admit I haven't read much about Were-folk and other creatures, but I doubt I could have chosen a better introduction.Ha, I mainly got the book 'cause its cover was pretty (though different than the cover on this version).  However, it was so nicely told I will probably read it again in a year or so.  I will definitely buy the sequel, though the young heroes will have aged some 17 years in that time.***Addendum, I'm listening to the audio version of the book. It's been so long since I read the story. Many props to the narrator. At first, I had doubts about her voice, but 11 CD's in, I find it very fitting.",5,1

Belle thought it would be simple as just turning it over to the proper authorities at the right time. She knew that she had a valuable well sought after disk, but she didn't think kidnappings would take place or dead bodies would show up. Great read, i highly recommend this book.",5,1
1023195,What could have been?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  When it comes to sports there are always those storylines of &#8220;what could have been?&#8221; when someone&#8217;s career is cut short by tragedy.  In this particular case it came in terms of a rising star getting blasted by a fastball to the head, tragically cutting Joe Castle&#8217;s career short before it ever really started.  But the real underlying plot for this particular story revolves around Joe Castle and Warren and Paul Tracy&#8217;s lives post incident.  Warren, the perpetrator of the beanball has always insisted that it was an accident.  His son, Paul, on the other hand does not buy into his father&#8217;s antics.  Paul, being Joe&#8217;s biggest fan at the time of the incident, believes the throw was intentional.  Now, with his father sick, he is determined to find closure for all parties included.  It&#8217;s a great story that any Grisham fan should check out.",4,1
5560767,Claimed by the Elven King (Part 3) is an excellent read!,"I'd already read Parts 1 and 2 (borrowed from a friend), so I had to buy Part 3 to continue the story.  Now I can't wait to get Part 4, which the author said will be the concluding part, containing all 3 remaining parts that she originally intended to publish separately.  I cant wait to read the rest of the story!  I'm a dedicated J.R.R. Tolkien fan, so I love the elvens in his books.  Sethian in this story reminds of Legolas, as a result, but much better because he's more &#34;alive&#34;.  The stories are an intense romance, but their underlying premise is believable.  I think she's laid the ground work well for the first half of the overall tale.  I'm sure the King's jealous Queen will make her presence well known in the 2nd half.  I'm certain she'll be livid with jealousy when she learns that Emily has become pregnant, particularly &#34;so quickly&#34;, as the King noted in Part 3.

I was not looking for an Alien rehash.Could have gotten a 4 out of me if we'd just abandoned that needless sideshow.I will admit it continues in Danny's tradition of looking at the psychological effects of unusually harsh and unrealistic circumstances (ie: Zombies in 28 days later)But unlike 28 days later, we did not need a monster to pop up in this one. We had a dieing world and harsh environment enough without adding a slasher in the mix.This is no 28 Days later,.",2,0

For the rest of us, it is disappointing and boring.",1,0
9079543,A Spoof with lots of laughs! More like 3 1/2 stars,"This flick is a comedy that will entertain a lot of folks, especially those who like Steve Martin. I personally hated the original Pink Panther versions with Peter Sellers from the 60s, and this time around I only went because of Steve Martin. I wouldn't call this Pink Panther a remake, but instead it is its own movie. It's a phantastic comedy and Steve Martin shines. Sure there are all the predictable funny mishaps but there are also quite a few new ideas to amuse the viewers. Basically you can forget about the storyline and things like that, because it's not really about that, instead it's about a 90-minute slap-stick flick and comedy show so to speak. The film barely makes the PG rating and it should be more like PG-13 although there are only a couple of scenes that are at issue. Fact is that it's a funny movie and my wife said she wants to own it on DVD once it's released on DVD. You can take your popcorn and relax as you watch this comedy, and my guess is that most folks will enjoy themselves.",4,1

6314418,Excellent inexpensive smoothing boyshort,"I'm between sizes, and according to the size chart need the larger of the two -- this results in fairly light control.  They smooth nicely and don't smooth away curves you want to keep.  If you're looking for firm control, then since they run a little big, it might be more effective to go a size down.  The boyshort is a great idea.  There is almost no control in the boyshort part which is genius, it really does go a long way towards eliminating lines.I'm quite tall (5'11) and these come all the way up on me with plenty of clearance.  Since I would like them to do a little more than smooth, I've ordered a smaller size, so I will report back if there are any length problems with sizing down.Edit: 5/16/2014 -- I didn't run into any length problems when sizing down.",5,1

Nothing is pushed or forced here. What makes this cd stand out from all the other bubble-gum pop offerings, is the fact that under the surface of bland simplicity, there's something really addictive - shiny sonic details that stick in your head. Annie's music is unengaging enough to make a pleasant background, yet original enough not to get tired and old quickly. Simply attractive pop product - tastes like good pop-corn.",4,1

8947161,Shirley's farewell to Fox and her childhood,"This film is a priceless good-bye to and from Shirley at the Fox Studios. The film uses clips from her very earliest efforts to portray her toddler self all the way up to the current story of an orphan (what else!) who is adopted by vaudevillians Jack Oakey and Charlotte Greenwood after her parents die of something when she is a baby. All three yearn to set up a ""normal"" life on the farm her birth parents left to them. Of course Shirley must win over the crusty, mean-spirited local townsfolk in order for her family to claim their rightful place in the small town life they crave. Oakey and Greenwood are smashing as Shirley's parents; their talents literally ooze from their performances, and Shirley is poignant in her good-bye to her status as the most outstanding child film performer of all time. The fact that Shirley could hold her own with the two scene-stealing old showmen is a triumph! Don't miss this underrated Shirley Temple film.",4,1

She was in great shape,and the sexiest I've  ever seen her.That's one of my favorites from the CD,along  with,&quot;B'Wana She No Home.&quot; Karen  sounded so different on this  record.Madonna couldn't come close to Karen's,&quot;Don't cry for me  Argentina.&quot; If only Karen was a Actress,she would have been fantastic  in the play and film. This album came out on CD last year,and its a must  buy for anyone who loves the Carpenters.",5,1

All the impoverished widow, Margaret Esterly, intends to do is to sell three erotic journals left by her late husband.  All Michael Hawthorne, Earl of Montraine intends to do is to marry an heiress so that his mother and sisters may continue to live in the exorbitant manner to which they've been accustomed.

3337449,Dragged a Bit,Tom Kratman relies on the &#34;interlude&#34; a bit too much in this installment of the Carerra Series. I kept waiting for the big battle between the Tauran Union and poor little Balboa and it never happened. Just a lot of Amazons get chopped up and sacrificed for a greater strategy never made clear. This is most likely a way to drag the series out another 2 or 3 novels but I want to read and 'see' more than hints at the overall strategy Patricio will use to defeat the Taurans. I'll admit I am impatient but I would be happier if the series stopped jumping around so much. I am 20% into Come and Take Them and finally realized the book started prior to The Amazon Legion although it is billed as a sequel. Would have been nice to know that or have it explained early on.All that said I enjoy Kratman's writing and this series.,4,1

8793306,A JOLTING EXPERIENCE!,"Although this film may not be as effective in the shock department as it was upon its release almost 35 years ago, it's still a thriller to be reckoned with...........A doll containing a fortune in heroine is planted in Suzy's (Hepburn) home while an incredibly elaborate and sinister scheme ensues.  A gripping tale of a blind woman being terrorised in her own apartment builds up into a frenzied tale of GENUINE jump-out-your-seat suspence! - this is actually one of the first films of that evasive and unique genre........  As the cat and mouse game gets going, Suzy proves to be an elusive and formidable match for Arkin and company........... I distinctly remember seeing this movie at the State Theatre in Woodland, California at the age of 7, (1967). The scene where practically the whole audience jumped off their seats IS jolting and (obviously) unforgettable!",5,1
7583056,2 year review,"So we've had this for 2 years now and I'm happy to say we have no complaints.  It works like a charm and we haven't had to replace anything on it.  It cooks evenly and well, and is just a great pressure cooker.We were trying to find a pressure cooker that would last and this really was a great choice.The only thing that I sometimes find annoying is trying to close it!  My wife doesn't have a problem but for some reason sometimes I don't line it up right and can spend 5 minutes trying to get it shut.  I guess someone just needs to show me how to do it :).*Edit: We've had this 4 years now and still no problems at all. We use it very often, for sure more than 100 times since purchasing and really we have no problem. We're so happy to not have to buy another pressure cooker, let's hope it goes another 4 years!",5,1

In fact, fair warning to introverts or those who embarrass easily...be careful where you read it ~ because you WILL laugh out loud!!But don't let the first part of this review fool you. Michelle's real stories about faith (or lack thereof), childhood beliefs (and misbeliefs), motherhood (and motherhood &#34;failures&#34;) leave no doubt in the reader's mind as to her authenticity in all things. While she drew me in with her humor, her message of hope for those who have questions about their faith (don't we all?) brings intrinsic value to this skillfully woven story.I gave my first copy away...and I never do that. I highly suggest you order more than one copy, because as soon as you read it, you'll want to share Michelle's message with others!",5,1

8998960,If you want to watch something really bad,"This is by far the single worst mini-series I have ever seen. Horried special effect. The best part of the movie is the first 5 minutes with the earthquake with the bicycle rider. It went downhill from there.They say if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters and gave them enough time, the complete works of Shakesphere could be written. The show 10.5 would rate about 16 monkeys and forty five minutes to knock out, so long just for length.Was there anything postive. yes, the bike rider, the Goldengate bridge going down and the end credits (it was over). The overall story idea is really cool, just all the action and dialouge was horrid. I belive this is what they call a Resume Stain of a miniseries.",1,0
3118792,Kept interest throughout,"Meg Whitman's foreword set up this volume well and made me feel like this book would be as interesting as the product summary suggested it would be. Rebooting Work was very interesting, easy-to-read, and engaging.Maynard Webb possesses a rare ability to actually talk about himself and the work he has done (in the context of framing a point) without actually tooting his own horn or treating this book like a long-form resume or history of accomplishments. The book also avoids becoming peppy with a ""sell"" about following your passions and abilities if you want to become truly successful and content. While it makes these points, it feels more authentic and engaging. Again, I believe all of this can be contributed to Webb ""walking the walk"" as well as talking the talk.I read this book in a day and have revisited select portions of it to think more about the points Maynard makes. This isn't the exercise in redundancy one would expect since the text is very conversational as well as informative.",5,1
5075392,AMAZING SHORT STORY!,"Great little short story! This is the Prequel to ""Mortality"" a zombie apocalypse book. It kinda gives us the back story of what happened when the first and second wave hit United States.

I'm pretty sure that the 4 people we read about will be in ""Mortality"". We get to see how they cleared the zombies out of the High School that they will be staying at in the next book. We get the feel of what these people went through and how hard it was for them to survive.I really enjoyed this short story very much and I know that ""Mortality"" will be amazing. ""Mortality"" releases March 19, 2013. Just right around the corner and I can't wait!",5,1

My son is involved in Universal Kempo Karate and has used this book to move to the top of his class in the Front Kick after just a short time.  The focus on the biomechanical aspects of this kick will improve your power and enhance your safety.  In addition, the sequential photography is excellent in conjunction with the step by step instructions.  Moving beyond the basics, a number of variations are also covered, making this something close to an encyclopedic reference on the Front Kick.

3766143,Crime / Trial Novel from the Bench view,"Most crime novels, a la John Grisham, focus on the defendant, the prosecution, or the police.  While there are elements of these three viewpoints, it is refreshing that this novel concentrates on the judge of a high-profile , gang- and drug-related murder trial.  The story starts fast, continues its pace, and has a neatly resolved conclusion.  The author's expertise with the law is clearly evident.I have two reservations - the plot resolutions are almost too neat . . . ALL the loose ends are tied up, and this would rarely happen in real life.  Also, the inclusion of an historical, 19th century story involving hanging of two Irish immigrants as the result of a clearly flawed trial, while interesting in its own right, does little to advance the the novel's story. The old story is a cautionary tale against the death penalty, but most of the novel is already slanted in that direction.",4,1

8950280,What Ties These Three Stories Together?,"Not much, it is way too subtle for me to understand what these 3 women's lives and stories have in common. This is one of those films where you appreciate the magnitude of your problems compared to the characters' as theirs are 100 times worse than yours. I might have appreciated this film more if it had focused on one of the women and only told her story.Why does Kyra Sedgwick's Delia stay with a man who despises her and have 3 kids with him? How about Parker Posey's Great going from also ran editor to superstar - is it really that easy? Why is Fairuza Balk's Paula out in a club and interested in the Norwegian dude? Each one of these could have used more backstory.Ron Leibman's Avram Herskowitz is an obvious ripoff of Alan Dershowitz.Rebecca Miller directed and wrote the film based on her book. This movie looks like it was shot on tape in an eternally smoky haze - was that the only way to ""soften"" these characters?",2,0
8358537,Beautiful Story,"Robert and Jane were the epitome of complicated. They each brought their own baggage to to story and they each blamed the other.

1229598,A nice twist to the fairy tale,"This is the well-known story of a princess whose evil stepmother tries to have her killed.

They live in a house very happily until the queen finds that Snow White is not dead.  She finds Snow White and tricks her into eating a poisoned apple. Snow White dies. She is awoken from her death by the kiss of a prince and they live happily ever after.The reason I enjoyed this version of Snow White more than others that I have read was that is was not as much of a fairy tail like story and more of a darker approach to it. The seven dwarfs, for example, are not shown as happy little creatures that sing and dance all day long.  They are merely shown as small, kind men. The illustrations in this book are so beautiful even though they are not the bright colors that would usually go along with this story.",5,1

It has cushions on the bottom to keep it off the bottom of my new sink-no scratching!  There is a flat place in the middle for laying utensils of putting cups/glasses at an angle to dry.  The dish rungs are far enough apart to hold good sized/thick plates.  I am a happy camper!,5,1

Which is very odd considering 3.0 doesn't take up that much power. So now I have it connected to a 2.0 port and the battery consumption is much better but at the cost of a very slight response time.Overall, it is a great keyboard perfect size for my needs fast response since it is 2.4 Ghz, with good battery consumption when on a 2.0 port.",4,1

I just couldn't believe how insensitive and sinister the characters of Gloria and Connor are!  In the case of Gloria, is there really such kind of a mother?I enjoyed the story and most readers who like romantic reads will.  I also find the bits and pieces of life lessons scattered all throughout as worthy of a couple of minutes of pondering.The next installment is not due until 2014.

I need to use a spoon which needs to be long enough to reach the bottom and it doesn't really take a huge amount of time but it can be a messy process.

3954111,I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a wonderfull gothic romance.  I have to admit that at the beginning of the book I was not quite sure where the story line was headed, but I was very pleasantly surprised. In the beginning of the book you meet Angel Van Ostrand, a gentleman that has come home from war with his own set of issues after effects of being wounded in battle. Angel has come home to his father, who works endlessly to discover ways to prolong the lives of others, through medical experimentation. When Angel and his father find a woman who was left for dead the story line truly begins to unfold.  This story had many pleasant surprises to it that I did not see coming.

2926926,Gritty,"Sharp, dark with a drug-induced dystopian flare, Katja is the story of chemical dealers, druggies and dreamers, all on a quest to escape their island prison. An unconventional collection of anti-heroes and antagonists, it's remarkably similar to the gritty tales of Sonja Blue by Nancy A. Collins. It's a toss up whether the sheer violence wins out over a theme of the struggle to find a better life. But it's all good, dark and fast paced, like being stuck in a trunk during a drunken joyride. Recommended for horror collections looking for something outside of the same old authors and styles.Contains: violence, language, drug use",4,1

8476365,"Short, Sweet, and Oh, So Hawt!","I had the honor of receiving an advanced copy of this anthology, and my review is for Secret Obsession by Olivia Linden:This sexy short is perfect for an afternoon &#34;quickie&#34; or a pre-slumber delight. It packs a powerful punch of erotic, sensual, and some may even think, forbidden love. Finn and Sylvia are not just star-crossed lovers, they're step brother and sister who've been secretly lusting each other from afar.After a chance encounter when Sylvie gets a flat tire and Finn pulls over to help her out, they cave in to the pent up lust they've been harboring since their parents got married. Their encounters and secret rendezvous are filled with such intense eroticism that as the reader, you'll feel like a voyeur observing these two lovers succumb to their forbidden passion. It ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger leaving the possibility for a full story of the fallout of Finn and Sylvie's revelation. Great job Ms. Linden!",5,1
8678563,HORRIBLE LEAVE THE OLDER STUFF ALONE,"I Totally hated this movie!!!! It had nothing to do with Jason, just sex and a running idiot who sets traps and kidnaps??? This IS NOT JASON!!

Nothing but sex and foul mouths.......I am a die hard horror fan, I could watch the original Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Slumber Party Massacre, Howling... ect all day long. But this worthless crap isn't even worth my time. All I have to say is watch out cause I am sure they will start remaking Slumber party massacre! Now dont get me wrong those showed their fair share of boobs and sex, but it didn't normally last long....a remake of that will no doubt be hard core porn and the whole point of the movie is gone!!

5306412,The perfect how-to handbook for all writers,"Janice  has proven herself to be an amazing author of both fiction and non-fiction. After reading her latest book, Writing and Selling the Great American Novel,I believe she has taken the role of mentoring to a whole new level. While reading her book, I was amazed at the resources she provides to both new authors and experienced alike. She offers advice to the person sitting on their couch thinking about starting their novel straight through to those working on selling their completed book. One chapter I found very relevant in today's publishing world was her chapter on self-publishing. I think it makes this book a must have for most writers. The best part was reading it with Janice's rare ability to make everyone laugh. Her sense of humor carries through and makes this book fun to read. I loved it and highly recommend it.",5,1

Jensen and Dean are genuine and likable characters. Each has his/her own personal struggles that hinder them emotionally. Added to this relationship dance that these two characters have is an ongoing mystery from the first book in the series, Burn for Me.

There are two stories in this book, and each have different endings, depending on which one the reader chooses.  This allows the readers to experience the consequences of the characters' actions.  What a great idea!Lying, testing bounderies, peer pressure--it is all addressed in this book.  The dialogue may be a bit much for mothers reading it before giving it to their daughters, but who does not get a headache from their tweens' incessent talking?This book is wholesome--not preachy.  If Nicole O'dell writes it, parents do not have to worry about the message!  This is a great way to get your daughter hooked on reading.  It would make an excellent gift.  I recommend it.",5,1

I mistakenly bought this, even especially looking for the large format edition, and found that it was not the one I remembered from my childhood.  The original translation in entitled Peter's Adventures in Blueberry Land and in translated by Sheila LaFarge.  I found the original to be much more quaint and it correctly identifies the mother in red as Mrs. Lingonberry, not Mrs. Cranberry.  Why would they translate it as cranberry, when Elsa Beskow goes to the trouble to try and illustrate her botanicals correctly?  Anyway, I wanted others to avoid the same mistake and disappointment.  I wish the publishers and booksellers had made the difference more clear.BTW, so far, findings of Sheila LaFarge translation are very expensive!",2,0
6586462,Works great.  Priced really well.,"I have about 9 switches in my house, scattered about the floors and rooms.  The house has wired network segments for most devices (Roku, Xbox, servers, desktops, etc) and the switches are used to extend gigabit connections, and add devices at single network end points all over the house. Wireless is used only for laptops and tablets.I always search for good values in network components.  I've started using TP Link products in the past year, and have been quite pleased with their value, and this switch is no different.  Its built nicely, it works fine, and its a good value.Gigabit Ethernet switches have become a basic commodity, and prices have come down.  At this point, there's little difference between most switches, as they are extremely basic devices based on a single computer chip (most made by the same couple of chip manufacturers vendor).  The differences are in quality of assembly and cost.  And this device is well worth the price",5,1

The author does a wonderful at explaining ""how these habits form"", ""what keeps it going"", and offers practical steps on how you can break the never ending cycle.

4146533,Classic Jeff Cooper,"This book is a survey of handguns as weapons of personal defense--exactly how Jeff Cooper saw them.  It goes through the history of the sidearm from its beginning as a weapon carried in a saddle holster to what was at the time of writing a new development, the double-action self-loading pistol.  It is classic Cooper in the strength of the opinions offered, but it's also interesting to see how much he was willing to change his views when he learned or created new ideas.  The chapter on fighting with a handgun comes before the Modern Technique that Cooper spent decades teaching.  The book is dated now and will appeal mostly to Cooper fans and to those interested in the history of firearms.Review by the author ofA Draft of Moonlight",4,1

1568575,A classic on the history of the Pacific War,"As far as I know this is THE classic on Japan in World War II (at least for those of us who don't read japanese), in the same way that William Shirer's 'The rise and fall of the Third Reich' is on Germany. As such, this book should be the starting point for anyone who wants to read about Japan in World War II, and maybe also for the Pacific War in general. This book deserves more reviews (like William Shirer's book, which anyone can see is a classic based on the number of reviews), but I guess most people who read about World War II are interested in the European theatre. A point of notice to those who are mainly interested in military history: The book has a slow start. The first 200+ pages is dedicated to everything that happened before Pearl Harbor, all the diplomacy etc. Once the war starts however, this is pure military history, and you will see that it was worth getting through those first 200 pages.",5,1

The sequel &quot;At San Quentin&quot; has a considerably different character. Folsom Prison, however, must be THE place where Johnny Cash really wanted to perform.

1857318,getting better,"I think the author may have hit her stride with this one. Yes, I was as irritated as heck at Ethan (though, darn, he somewhat redeemed himself before it was too late, no?). But this story was pretty well woven, I thought. I didn't guess who was behind the shifter dodginess, which is good because I like to be surprised. Though, as bizarrely as it might sound because I know the cutie from gramps office can never have Merit, I almost feel a little mad about him getting a potential girlie shofter to settle down with.To be honest, I think that's pretty much all I have to say on the matter. I really liked the story line. I thought the emotions in this were handled really well. And the writing was way cleaner than the first two books and hence dragged me into the story far faster and with a whole lot more vigour. I'll certainly be reading on to book 4.",4,1

Get over the first page, which is a bit weak, after that it really gets so much better and picks up on pace. Will add to this review when I finished the book, but seriously, don't miss it!Update: I have finished the book, in two sessions, one has to sleep ;-), and have only one question: When does the next book in this series come out? I want to read more of this story!If you are looking for a Fantasy book with a lot of humor, some serious topics like bullying intelligently covered and that provides good, but realistic role models for girls, look no further! BTW, with ""realistic"" I mean how the different girls interact with each other and others, not that one of them is a witch ;-)",5,1
977329,I waited too long to read this book...,I should have read this book years ago when I was in my adolescent years.  This book is phenominal in every aspect.  Anne's writings are beautiful. She wrote well beyond her 14 years of age.  She was saturated with wisdom.  This diary focuses on the beginning of their ordeal living in the attic in hiding from the Germans.  It goes into great detail about everyday life spent living with a number of individuals in a confined space under hostile circumstances.  Anne goes from child to young women in her diary.  It is a great read for every age group.  It allows you to appreciate your environment and to be thankful for what you have. .,5,1

1139645,Classic for a reason,"It's too bad that technology today isn't what it is in Robert Heinlein's world. His books are filled with fascinating ideas and philosophies, and this book is not an exception.I can only imagine what life would be like on Luna. While this isn't happening now, Heinlein makes it sound believable, from what he reveals to us of Loonie life, and the philosophy also makes sense. This book is also full of practical knowledge and commonsense, and it seems that our own government could learn a thing or two from this book. It's also a good romp as a simple sci-fi novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like sci-fi and philosophy, you will too. If you're not really into either, then oh well. :)",5,1

It did me worlds of good to read about her experiences as a mom and her feelings about those experiences. She's like the friend you wish you had while going through pregnancy, birth, and the first few years of your children's lives. If you've ever spent hours in Mommy and Me classes, lost your temper with your kids, felt shy about approaching other moms, or fretted over trying to be a perfect parent, then this book is for you. Highly recommended!",5,1
2250525,An enjoyable read!,"I have read many books on George Patton, but so far this one is the most enjoyable book to read. It is not a definitive biography, nor do I think it was written to be so. This is just a concise yet detailed description of Patton from beginning to end. Patton was a master of the ""one liners""; yet eloquent at the same time. He could be cruel yet tender, brave but yet emotional, an inspirational leader yet full of self doubt.This book seems to be the inspiration for the movie, because almost all the scenes are described in this book. Yet I noticed the movie is based off of a book by Ladislas Farago. This is an inspirational story for everyone. George Patton struggled with dyslexia in his youth, but through his self-will and detirmination he willed himself to exceed. A great American story that is a must read!",5,1
6544614,"Not perfect, but very good headphones","I hate over the head headphones, unless I'm sitting and relaxing and only listening to music. If I'm out in the yard, walking the dog, at work, etc. I like the behind the head style. First, you don't get the ""oh, you had headphones on"" hair... and it is also much less annoying over time.What I like: The Phillips SHS8200's produce very good quality sound; are comfortable on the ears; fold easily and nicely so that they take up little space; and they are attractively priced.What I don't like: There is no adjustment for size (typical of this style unfortunately). So, they might feel a little big or a little small, depending on the size of your noggin. It's a relatively minor complaint however.",4,1

8615214,In a word: Brilliant,"David Fincher hits the nail on the head with this one. The tension does not let up, and just builds on and on, slowing down to an almost unbearable climax.Fincher is evidently a skilled director, and he is lucky to work  with skilled actors as Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey who is  terrific in his role, giving Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter a run for the  money. Gwyneth Paltrow is in this too, as Pitt's wife, but her role is a  discreet one. One could say she adds the air of feminine beauty and grace  to the movie, a pleasant change to a constant tension  build-up.Congratulations must also go to Howard Shore with his beautiful  and exquisite music, perfect for this movie, even when the credits show up  the tense atmosphere is still somewhat hanging around densely, because it's  David Bowie with his strange &quot;The Heart's Filthy Lesson&quot;. Oh  yes...this is a film that must be seen. If you haven't you, you really  don't know what you're missing.",5,1

Did Shep ever see them again? So many details were left out and the one that really bothered me is what happened to Blaze and the others who went on the plane?! And did the boys parents die?! Because that how it sounded when Shep found him... but all in all a great series.",4,1

I chose the Zondervan Strongest because:  The binding is sewn; the print is a little clearer and precise, but not necessarily larger; the book is more compact, but not much; the definitions in the back are more precise and to the point.Nelson offers a very nice topical index and other  miscellaneous charts in the back of their Strongs.  Zondervan likewise offers Nave's topical bible index in the back of their version (minus the verses), plus miscellaneous charts.  Both of these  versions are equally nice to have.ANY version of Strong's is a must for any believer, in my humble opinion.  It is second to the bible only and will give you hours upon hours of delightful research into God's Word.",5,1

I love it so much I have gone so far as use my soldering iron to replace the worn-out button switches.  (They happen to use the exact same switch as the ubiquitous MS mice.)This device fits my hand like a glove, and saves desk space since it never needs to move.  The lack of rollers isn't such a big plus since the advent of optical mice, but it is still nice.While this is a stupendous product, you should never buy a pointing device or keyboard for the first time via mail-order.

I used to just make simple cupcakes and frost them normally with a knife, and then I became more ambitious and began cutting off the tips of ziploc bags and filling them with icing to pipe them onto the cupcakes. After I became annoyed doing that, I decided to take the plunge and buy a kit like this. I'm so happy I did! It comes with several different tips, most of which I use. It comes with both reusable and disposable piping bags, and I find that I can reuse the disposable ones if I wash them thoroughly enough. The included instructions really helped clear up anything I was confused about, too. I'm so glad I got this set...

I didn't like the idea of trusting only one clip since I have a significant amount invested in my 60D and lens. What I found is that a battery grip completely fixes this issue, now both clips can be used but are both on the right side of the camera and completely out of the way when taking and review photos.The strap itself seems very well made and very comfortable and completely exceeded my expectations for the price.",5,1

It was hard to believe, but Todd compressed and put this entire masterpiece on side two of Utopia's debut VINYL album, clocking in at (an all time ""record"" on vinyl) at 30:22.

Fortress Frontier is a highly impressive sequel, one that addresses the issues readers had with the first book whilst improving on all the things readers loved about the first book. Replacing Oscar Britton with Alan Bookbinder as the primary protagonist for this book was a bold move by Cole, but it as also a necessary one, and to Cole's credit it was executed almost to perfection.

I just can't imagine spending any time with them in real life.  That might be okay for some books, but a cozy mystery should be an escape, and this was one I didn't want to escape to.

It reads like a woman coming out of a funk and for Jackson, that really works! It's a really wonderful book of stories, including the one that first aroused her husband to stalk and date her. The entire book is excellent, but it always strikes me as incredibly unpleasant that her widowed husband put this collection together with his NEW wife and then dedicated it to HER! Shirley surely turned over in her grave on that one.",5,1

We have tried several batches of rice - different quantities - and it just does not measure up.  It sometimes burns the rice, sometimes it sticks and it boils over every time.  Next.Now I find out that I am past the Amazon return date - it will be given away most likely.",1,0
5894709,"Not a very good album, and Beyonce is still conceited","I'm not a big fan of Destiny's Child, especially since the other two girls left the group.  I'm not fond of Beyonce either I just like her name.  Beyonce is too conceited for me.  She reminds me so much of Diana Ross, you would think that she's related somehow. She takes over all of the songs, you hardly ever hear Kelly or Michele and I think they have beautiful voices whenever Beyonce will let them sing.  I don't own the new album but I did hear sample songs from it, and I don't like them at all, except for &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Bootilicious&quot;.  Until Beyonce comes down from her high horse, and let the other girls sing a few songs or more I'll continue not to like them.",1,0
2716347,This play comes off like a breeze.,"It's completely relatable generation to generation.  When you grow up you sometimes forget what it was to be a kid when your parents were out with their friends having the entire conversation over your head even if the conversation was about.  Here we see what it's like when the kid grows up, but is still the kid technically.  No one really listens to him or values his contribution, they just love him and that's enough to make the dysfunction tolerable.  A fun play to read, watch, listen, and remember how you were made to feel like this guy.  Most of all, it has great roles for older actors.",5,1

Maybe more about French cooking and God with a little less about the author and his failed relationships. Those promised ""hints on how you too can become a Master Chef"" are just not there.As I continued reading through the book it felt more like the Author was patting himself on the back for trying to discover why relationships fail??????  The best part of the book was the moments when Rodger, the Chef/Mystic was allowed to show his wisdom.This is the first book I have read from James Twyman and I was not impressed.

But nothing like the ""frankenfoods"" debate.When protesters at the local university gather to protest genetically modified food research, Alex is on the scene to cover the demonstration. What she didn't count on was having to report that the school's agriculture building exploded and that a prominent university spokeswoman had been beaten to death in her lab.Alex also didn't count on having to solve the murder mystery herself.Using her widely acclaimed Gen-X writing style, Beth Saulnier takes an issue from today's headlines and turns it into a fast-paced, thrilling mystery. Alex Bernier is as fun and irreverent as always as she wades deeply into the politics of protest and the corridors of university power.A great addition to Saulnier's catalogue.",4,1

It doesn't have HDMI and only one Component HD output.  So naturally we needed something to allow us to plug in the latest technology, a blu-ray player we purchased.  The Switcher works great.  We've had no problems and I personally don't notice any degrading of the quality through the switch.  I would certainly purchase again before buying a new television when ours is still working great!  The only draw back, no remote.  You have to get up and manually make the switch.",5,1

I especially enjoyed experimenting with the Amazon Perks explained in Chapter 32, but the entire book is loaded with careful guidance from an inspirational lady who has learned by trial and error and is willing to share her knowledge of things that work.

5226682,Better than the first one,I like the way the author pointed out what happens when teamwork or just not thinking about consequences can endanger an entire group.

While this story was really well done and the hot factor between Cassie and Alex was through the roof, it was unnecessarily long, causing me to skim a lot after the halfway point and to be the length it was and end in a cliffhanger for a concluding book is a little frustrating- I feel some fat could have been trimmed and fit in the end in one book. However, I did enjoy it and will definitely read the next one because I have to know the fate of Alex and Cassie now!!!",4,1
612632,really stupid,"this book has two major flaws:1. silly denial of historical timeline - Tzar Nicolas' daughter (anastasia) is a young woman in contemporary times, with a 3 year old son?? The Tzar's daughter's lover is 33 years old?? This book creates tension between contemporary politics and leftover Tzarists with a disregard for the evil Lenin and Stalin. I appreciate fudging historical facts to tell a story, but leaving out a huge chunk of Communist Soviet Union is lazy, not creative.2. abundance of cliches substituting for competent writing --""three story victorian painted a lovely shade of pale yellow....decorative gingerbread geegaws and doodads,""...""the sun rose over siberia, ascending into the blue heavens...""

884799,"Fascinating, careful study of quantum physics and consciousness","I read this right after James Gleick's ""Chaos,"" and while the level of the prose in ""Quantum Enigma"" isn't up to Gleick's, this is a fascinating book. QE deals head-on with the weirdness of quantum mechanics that a lot of books seem to intentionally avoid. The authors explore the possible relationship of quantum mechanics to consciousness, but are very careful not to make any grandiose claims (and they trash the pseudoscientific ""quantum"" nonsense found in pop culture drivel like ""What the [bleep] do we know?""

Just the logistics alone of writing a war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. seemed like an impossible task, but Clancy managed to pull it off brilliantly. This book is a page turner.

5210415,The Tooth Fairies Gift,"This book starts out talking about a friend who lost his tooth and then gets a gift from the tooth fairy for it. The main character decided that she wants a gift as well so she tries to think of how she could lose teeth. From her understanding, eating lots of sweets could make her teeth fall out. Because of this thought, the book completely switches the story line from wanting to lose her tooth to get a gift, over to how eating lots of sweets makes your stomach hurt. After quite a few pages about eating sweets, the story all of a sudden transition back to the young girl getting a loose tooth and getting a gift all on the last page.The book is cute, the story simply loses focus throughout the middle. The pictures are nicely done and kept my interest.",4,1

There was nothing to grasp on to, no part of the story that made sense or read well. I ended up skipping most of it simply because it was hard to read.Skip this one it is truly a waste of time.

It's one of the few stereo receivers available that gives you quality, style, and plenty of power to push inefficient speakers. Most of the manufacturers these days are focusing on the home theater market and building elaborate units with bells and whistles but not necessarily quality. This receiver looks great, sounds great, produces pure stereo power, and will bring a smile to your face. At $400 or lower (you can find it for $299 if you look hard enough), it's a smart purchase. I'm grateful that Harmon Kardon recognizes the need to offer a simpler, stylish unit that focuses on stereo sound. I love it!",5,1

The reflection is not like a mirror, the overall background brightness is increased by ambient light.As for the bubbles, I found out the toughest ones are caused by very tiny lint on the screen.I ended up not using the film because I prefer sharper images and higher contrast, but I can't read in a well lit office.

The story is a good one, esp. if you read it in partnership with Hoover's other book about her move to the woods, The Years of the Forest, and tells the story of how she and her husband moved to the wilds of Minnesota in middle-age and what (and who) they found there.  The Gift of the Deer introduces us to Peter, Mama, Pretty, Friendly, and all the others who live in Hoover's &quot;neighborhood&quot; deep in the North Woods.Oh - and why is it great to read in the summer?

I gave 5 stars, however, there are a few very minor issues. Once you perform the initial pairing/sync, in order for your device to &#34;remember&#34; the earbuds, you have to turn on your listening device first and then turn on the earbuds; if not, the earbuds will continue to search for a device to pair with until you configure your listening device to connect to the earbuds. Also, it was stated that there is a 6 hour battery life, which is not accurate at all; it's more like 3-4. Overall, this was a good purchase.",5,1

3170861,Better Than Expected,"I have read some horrible reviews of Superman: Earth One and that kept me away from this book for a while.  However, knowing that Superman's mythos will be altered a bit in September 2011, I wanted to take a look at what a different type of Superman may feel like.  And let me also include that I thoroughly enjoyed J. Michael Straczynski's work on Amazing Spider-man when I was in college.  I thought Superman: Earth One was a fresh take on Superman.  I kept thinking, ""This is better than the reviews I've read.  When will this comic take a step back.  Were the negative reviews wrong?""  Yes.  This is a great comic book and I suggest Superman fans everywhere check it out.",5,1

1644187,Tremendous,"As required reading for a college course on Asian history, I picked up this book one night and finished it the next.  It is a heart-stoppingly real, rough and dramatic account of a young woman's ascent and descent in  the Red Army during Mao's reign in China.  At times I was moved to tears,  literally -- while commuting on a subway.  I was enthralled with the  author's &quot;voice&quot; in telling her own sad, victorious, heart  wrenching story from childhood through adulthood.  Red Azalea is an  important piece of writing which I'd recommend not only to students  interested in Chinese history, but to anyone who enjoys a real human story  with historical reality.",5,1

Most books on entrepreneurship focus on what you should do (you know those laundry lists), this book tells you what people actually do, and what people actually do is nothing less than surprising.The problem, however, is its tone of negativity towards the policy implication of start-ups. The author looks at it only from an economic standpoint rather than a broader social perspective. A high percentage of start-ups is going to fail, but you don't know who is going to fail before the fact, and society as a whole needs to provide ways-out for those ""unemployed"", not just for a living, but also for social stability and potential creativity.",4,1

The new itrip does not broadcast on 87.9 (FM channel that's generally not used by radio stations)! This was a big thing for me. It's renders the itrip practically useless on long trips.2. The tuner adjustment switch was changed and is much more difficult to use than the 2006 itrip. I don't know why this was changed.Bottom LineThough the new itrip is aesthetically nicer, it's functionality is subpar when compared to it's predecessor, the 2006 itrip.  Another example demonstrating that a newer version does not necessarily mean better.",2,0

You'll learn far more than you will from reading our leading periodicals and listening to most of the talking heads.

5602264,Very fey,"From the cover to the delicate Rose to the entire storyline, this book is very fey. It's like peeping through the veil to a life of shadows, shades, demons, angels, witches and other entities within our own world. Ms Swallow's style of writing and her use of the recovering Rose for a first-person perspective only serve to emphasise the ghostly feel of the story.There's no cliffhanger here - the book drifts to its natural end, though leaving events open to make way for a sequel or a whole series, as I understand will be the case. This had a nice balance of paranormal to romantic elements - I'd go as far as to say it's more urban fantasy than romance.I enjoyed the story and I look forward to reading more of this series.",5,1

The ""counterfeit son"" is Cameron Miller, 14-year-old son of Hank Miller, serial killer. When his ""Pop"" is killed in a police shootout, Cameron claims to be Neil Lacey, a victim supposedly murdered by Pop six years earlier. The third-person narrative hauntingly depicts the realities of post-traumatic stress. Tension rises steadily as Cameron/Neil struggles to escape Pop's shadow. The clues are in place, but so deftly blended into a tense emotional drama that it's difficult to determine the truth until a life-threatening climax lays bare all of Cameron's--or is it Neil's?--secrets.",4,1

It was a little depressing watching the way Roy and Cindy treated Pearl, but then Vernie, Sammie, and Ben gave her hope, and I just knew somehow she was giong to get herself out of that hell hole! I just wish we would have had a little back story on Roy (why was he in arizona?) and I wish that we could have read a little more happiness at the end. I am very happy with the epilogue. All of the great characters were a true family and I really hope we get to read more about them some day. Maybe Darrens story?",4,1

5282346,Rescued,A good story about getting rescued. The background on the culture was good except for explaining how the seven sins work today. I get how they were cursed but what does it mean that her sin is lust? Not much if she's still a virgin.,5,1

2665036,Career and Life Coach Sheri Hoff  loves this book,"When I purchased this book, I was feeling good about my spirituality and the direction I was heading in my life, but I still felt that I was missing a piece of the puzzle. While reading this book I was struck by the realization that some elements of my behavior and thought process were not ""just my personality"" but areas that God could bless and change for me. I learned while studying this book to let go of some deep past hurts. Hurts that I thought were already gone, but were really bubbling under the surface. This is a great book if you are willing to dig deep into your spirituality with an honest and open heart. I thank Beth for writing such liberating words based in scripture and for caring about people's hearts.Studying this book moved me to new levels. My life mission is to foster continuous learning, growth and to inspire people to truly tap their God given talents. Beth's book is one very useful tool in this process for people.",5,1

You can go all the way or partway -- this author doesn't judge. His tone is friendly and helpful throughout. I really got the impression that this was written to me, personally, by a friend. I recommend this book. You may still want to get a cookbook (my favorite is Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone by Deborah Madison), but this will get you started down a path that will improve your life, save some animals, and slow pollution.",5,1
742591,Words are NOT enough,"The most important and relevant point in the Power of Communication, for me, is Words are NOT Enough (Chapter 3).  Helio opens with an example from FEMA and the US Government when handling the Hurricane Katrina situation.  Having been in numerous roles in local, state and federal emergency management (yes, FEMA) over the years, and with FEMA during the Katrina recovery, Words are NOT enough - especially if not followed up by ACTION. This is perhaps the most important lesson in the Power of Communication for effective communications.",5,1

2182022,Very informative.,"Although I sometimes felt I was given too much detail, I found the book very informative and enlightening. It reveals too many members of the curia are uncommunicative, self-serving and generally judgmental of those who they feel are iinferior: women, lay men and children. The hierarchy is depicted as pretty much like many other human men searching for prestige and self-satisfaction. I won't go into the scandalous behavior that all too often has been deliberately overlooked by too many of the curia. Shame, shame..Mr. Thavis reveals time and again the outrageous behavior of those who have been called by God to serve but choose instead  to demonstrate a charade of Christ's teaching.I suspect there are those who would label the book, &#34;anti-Catholic&#34; but I think otherwise. Knowledge, I believe, is the only way we can hope to know the truth and &#34;grow in holiness&#34;.",4,1

She has to earn the woman's love but her brother loved Anne from the start. The girl with red hair and a personality to go with gets in all kind of mischievousness with her friend. When she grows up she wants everything to stay the same and learn the hard way that that is impossible. This is a truly awesome book and you should let all your daughters read it.

1900554,Page-turning anti-chick lit,"This was my first novel by Emily Barr and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Her main character, Evie, was a fleshed-out, three-dimensional person who carries a lot of baggage over a traumatic incident in her teens and allows it to affect all her relationships from that point on.Over the course of the novel, she readily admits her character flaws, which I appreciated as the reader, and over time sorts her ""stuff"" out, but not all the way, which lended realism to the plot.My only complaint about the book was the secondary ""mystery"" plot which kind of fell flat.  But overall I like Barr's style and will be looking up her other titles.",4,1

Even though her building kinda creeps her out she likes her neighbor Char that she just met and it seems Char might be able to shed some light on the mysteries she is facing. The reaction Char had to her was pretty strong and she seems puzzled a bit but determined to help her get to the bottom of her uniqueness. Glad to finally have an ally to help her get to the bottom of her mysterious ""gifts"" is almost too good to be true. What will happen next?This episode was amazing! Finally getting some answers about her heredity only deep end the mystery surrounding Kat :) Hopefully her true origins will be revealed inDark Child (The Awakening): Episode 4!

4225063,Excellent of summary of WWII radar technology,I have read five books discussing the technology that literally won the war.  I am struck by the politics and personalities that both aided and interfered with the critical decisions that had to be made with perfect timing.

7887799,Love this cookware set!,"I have needed some new pots and pans for a long time, so I got this 10-piece cookware set.  It is a good, basic set for someone that's just starting out on their own or for someone that needs a good replacement for their current set.  Keep in mind that the lids count as pieces!  You need to use plastic or wooden (not metal!) cooking utensils with these.  The following is what I liked and didn't like about the set:Pros-Nonstick-Quality material-Size of pot/pan is labeled on the bottom-Dishwasher-safe-Cooks food evenly-Silicone handles-Not flimsy, has some weight to them-Can be cleaned easilyCons-None so farThey work great, and I'm very happy with them!",5,1

Omg I was blown away by this series. Colton made me so mad at times by pushing Rylee away. But then he would turn around and do something absolutely amazing.

Leo seemed like a good guy who didn't want to hurt Janie intentionally but didn't want to get want to have her to get hooked onto him either.

2551602,Good book to read if you want to get out of debt!,"This is a good book to read if you want to get out of debt. It does provide some helpful hints and tips for getting debt free. Further, it points you in the right direction for living a debt free life.That said, if you are already living a debt free life and you pay off your credit cards every month (the book states that 60% of Americans do not), then you probably already know much of what is stated in this book. This book is for those who haven't thought much about their personal finances yet.",4,1

5523991,Another great story!,"Ms. Butler has given us another great story from her Seeking Serenity series. I love the independence of Mollie, the fact that she faces her problems with courage and stubbornness. She and Vaughn have a unique relationship and I love how it builds throughout the book. I also love how these books will intertwine with the relationships of the &#34;family&#34;...the four young women who bonded and are like sisters to one another.

For a God, Guy has tons of human character flaws and a love of choc chip cookies (not a character flaw!), while the love of his life, Emma, is a wonderful mix of fearful and brave, serious and hilarious and so much more.Another great thing about this series is that each is a story on its own; characters may re-occur but you don't have to read them in order to make sense of them.  I had read Book Two before realizing that there was a Book One!

AMZN replaced the first one and the second one is working perfect. Highly recommend any Mag HDD for Off-Air recording. It really beats VHS.,5,1
7142558,Very Practical,"The color of this case is light purple, which is kind of feminine I guess, and I got this case for my mother. Protects the ipad 3 well, feels very sturdy, and can be propped up in two ways. This is good because my mom watches a lot of Korean drama. Another cool thing is that the ipad display turns on when you flip the cover open, and turns off when you close it. I guess it detects light levels or something. But that feature potentially goes for all ipad cases.",5,1

2494911,Another fantastic book in the Ender's Game canon,"I had already read the graphic novels that depicted the first Formic war, so I already knew the outline of the story in this book.  But even with that foreknowledge, I was still impressed by how the novel was able to flesh out the characters so much.I shouldn't have been surprised, I guess.  Complex characters and moral dilemmas are staples of Card (and Johnston).  But it really was fun seeing character motivations, especially the interactions of Lem Jukes with his father and the way his perspective of his father changed back and forth.If you are fan of Ender's Game, you should definitely read the three Formic Wars books.  Start with &#34;Earth Unaware&#34; and work your way to this one.  I promise you won't be disappointed.",5,1

6113243,"THIS FORMER ""PONY"" IS JUST AS GREAT AS A SOLO ACT","Former lead singer of the now defunked Trick Pony, Heidi Newfield proves that she can stand all on her own with her solo debut, ""What Am I Waiting For.""  In my opinion, the attitude and delivery of these songs remind me of that of the truly great country ladies of years past(Tanya Tucker, Lorrie Morgan) back ""in the day"" before the Carrie's and Taylor's came along, and country music was about the music and not about the ""American Idol"" or the flash-in-pan singer of the moment.  There are many memorable listening experiences on this album such as, ""Cry, Cry (Til the Sun Shines Baby), the comical ending number, ""Knocked Up"" which could be a 2009 rendition of the classic Loretta Lynn ""One's on the Way"", and of course the top 15 single, ""Johnny & June. If you are looking for a musical diversion from the tween scene you will enjoy this album.  What are YOU waiting for?",5,1
882139,One man's opinion,"I thought that this was an excellent book. It was exhaustively researched, and has an abundance of factual information from both Japanese and American military records that make it a fascinating story to read.

What is it with these people?  Have they no ears?  Have they no sense of aesthetic taste? OOOHH!  I keep forgetting that they waste their lives within punk (one, two, three and lets go!) This recording surges from urgency.  From the need to go forward in a changing (for the worse) musical scenario.B & B is such a balanced approach to musical rendition.  Past and future are at once present.  Just listen to the jem, ""Watching Me Watching You"", a composition that blends both worlds effortlessly.  Monsieur Barr&eacute; works magic with texture and execution all along the recording.  Listen to ""Seal Driver"" and Flying Colours"".I love STAND UP and SONGS FROM THE WOODS above all Jethro Tull recordings, but certainly BROADSWORD AND THE BEAST must bue listened to with sharp and critical criteria.  Enjoy it.",5,1

3486556,A good page turner for the beach,"This book was enjoyable even though the main character had so little insight into herself and others (and she is a therapist!) that the reader could see plot twists coming way before they actually took her by surprise.  It was a great read until the end, I would have rather the main character did not find another man so soon as is implied.  Women need to learn to be strong on their own and for most of the book she was working toward just that.  I hope in a chapter never written she just remains friends with the man down the road and becomes a famous advocate for women, as a result of her bestselling book.  Haha!",4,1

It's not suitable for under 16---that's my opinion, of course.  When people are shot, torched, and stabbed, they're supposed to be dead. Since some of the characters continue on in spite of what has happened to them, I don't think those under 16 may remember that it's just entertainment and not real.",4,1

2768894,An amazing start to what will hopefully be a great series,"I liked this book.  I liked it a lot.  I thought the concept was good, and Wendig did some really interesting things with it.  But man, it was dark, bleak.And that was really my only problem with it.  Without at least a moment of light, the dark becomes humdrum and it starts to lose its power.  Miriam's life is unrelenting awfulness.  Whatever moments of joy she finds are immediately tempered by horror, by violence.  There is a point in the book where we actually see hope for her, where we see something that brings more dimension, where maybe for a moment we can smile.  And that moment makes me so excited for Mockingbird.So why, with my complaints, am I giving this 4 stars?  The writing was terrific.  The pacing good, and the characters, for all the darkness, were layered.  I cannot wait for Mockingbird, which I've already pre-ordered.  I think this is going to be one hell of a series.",4,1
629060,Funny as H*ll,"Great book! I picked this up thinking it would be a good Father's Day gift, and ended up having to buy myself a copy as well. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I laughed out loud as my kids gave me funny looks. The book is a collection of humorous stories that remind the reader that no matter what, your dad loves you: even if he does embarrass the hell out of you!Growing up in a military house, I could relate to the brutal honesty and colorful language without any offense, but I would recommend to those whom are a bit more sensitive be wary of the purchase. While the book isn't a long read and can be finished in one sitting, it is still a worthwhile break from more serious reading. If you are like me and read more than one book at a time you will welcome the comedic break it offers.",5,1

I think I'm going to be in this state for the next few days to be honest. I wasn't quite sure how I felt at first, but by the third or fourth chapter I was hooked. I was laughing, I was crying... I was an utter wreck. I knew Olivia. I empathized with her; with her choices, with her self-destruction, with her self-preservation. Oh my God! This book was torture; it was so real and true to life that it was painful. It evoked such feeling in me, and it's obvious in other reviews that I'm not alone. I will absolutely recommend this book to anyone asking. I need a stiff drink and a few days alone to collect myself after that read. Phew!",5,1
2608559,LOVE IT!!!,"I have always loved horses and this book is perfect if you want to read about horses. It even had a little bit of romance to, always a plus.

I've come to love it and am starting to sell my skills.  But I've been needing a good reference book, and I found this one at a used book store and knew I HAD to have it.  I bought it for a reference, as it has such great, detailed instructions for every kind of sewing task.  But I found it's so helpful that I'm reading it straight through.  I haven't even finished it yet, and I feel like it's improved my sewing already.  I'm devastated to see it's out of print, as I am going to tell all my friends to get it.",5,1

6864446,Very functional Keyboard,This Microsoft keyboard was automatically recognized within windows 7 and the software to configure the buttons works great. I would recommend this for gaming as well due to the contoured W key and the back lighting that is blood red. It has S1-S6 function keys for in game play that are easily programmed. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would rank this as high as some of my higher priced keyboards. If you can get this keyboard under $50.00 dollars then it is a must have . I hope this review ultimately makes up your mind when choosing a reasonably priced keyboard that truly is not cheap and does what any PC enthusiast would need.,5,1
1115268,Kept me on the edge,"I listened to the audiobook, and it reeled me in almost immediately, and kept me wanting to hear more of Annie's story.  You knew she survived the capture by The Freak, because she was relating the story to her shrink, but trying to anticipate how and when, and then her attempt to round out the 'why' really kept me into it. I thought it was exactly what it was billed as...a thriller.",5,1
8788989,Smacks with Glory,"If you are a student of movie history you will enjoy this rousing Tyrone Power vehicle that shows some history with fanfare. I don't doubt it is relatively accurate in historical fact. The movie is colorful, buoyant, and follows the life of one man, Pedro de Vargas, played by Power. Mostly filmed in beautiful regions of Mexico, it has good camera work. Good directing, and a good sprinkling character development as well. In the beginning we see his wealthy family in Spain and then it being crushed by the Spanish Inquisition. It follows the mother and fathers escape to Italy while Pedro, with two friends along to help him, head for the coast. They join Cortez in the fleet heading for the Indies and a assault on the indians of Mexico. The movie is ripe with nationalism and although may be upsetting to some, it nonetheless tells a somewhat realistic message of conquorers like Cortez. Good quality DVD with extras and decent replayability. This can be purchased as part of a set of classic movies here at Amazon.",4,1

I enjoy the fact that she leaves the sex to our imaginations but not in a prissy way. This story was realistic and deals with 2 very difficult but diverse topics; rape and dyslexia. She dealt with them well but without depressing the heck out of me. I think although I did get annoyed with the h towards the end because of how she pushed the H away, it was realistic. I really can recommend this book.",4,1

This is a fast-paced romp through high-level corruption with Reacher, as always, just a step ahead of his own early demise.

It would be nice if the seller posted microwave and dishwasher care. If there was a note in the box, my son threw it out when he unwrapped these...they were a gift to him since he loves to prepare and eat Asian dishes and likes to give them a nice presentation.

2245314,"Could also be called ""Buddhism for Business""","My personal belief is the entire 7 Habits/FranklinCovey collection can best be described as ""Buddhism for Business"". The values-based leadership models get to the core of some of the most basic tenets of Buddhism's focus on helping yourself through compassion and understanding others from their point of view. What ""The 8th Habit"" does is it adds depth to the 7 Habits material. Whereas the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People brings a person from dependency to interdependency, the 8th Habit brings it further from interdependency to leadership. It very nicely ties it all together. I would highly recommend this book, but only to someone that has either read or taken a workshop to internalize the 7 Habits material first. This book is worth reading but only as a sequel to the original.",4,1

With hard work and dedication she showcases that anything is possible. There are also instances throughout the book when we are reminded that no matter where we are there are more things that might unite us than divide us.Beautifully presented with heart and true feelings, Stalina is a triumph of not just the American spirit but the good within us all no matter where we might be.",5,1
5923914,Best since 'Falling',"Easy this is Dion's best album since 'Falling into you'. The French-Canadian Diva last attempted the ecletic album style on 'Let's talk about love' and failed miserably. Let's face it there were three good songs on that one. But she, thankfully, pulls off the ever so risky 'eclectic album' with a wise form. Instead of trying to do every kind of music there is (only dabbling in hip-hop for her backgrounds) she instead shoots for what she can do really well. The original version of 'A new day has come' is classic Celine. While '10 days' gets an almost Eric Clapton feel with its Folkiness. Other songs like 'Right in front of me' are tramendously modern Pop proving that classical training can easily outmatch the bubble gum 'natural talent' of Britney Spears. Plus Celine's cover  of 'At Last' is gorgeous.",4,1

In truth, angels are different aspects of human consciousness, variously attuned to certain elements of God consciousness.As in all of Rabbi Shapiro's books, he takes a rather simple formula and consistently repeats it; he does this, however, without resorting to simplistic formulations.

658304,Pretty good version of the New American Bible,"I found everything about this Bible great: the cover design, summaries, text layout, maps, etc. The only drawback--and it is a significant drawback, depending on your eyesight--is how thin the pages are. The pages used are extremely thin, which, although allows for a lighter and slimmer Bible, reduces the opacity significantly. This allows text from the back of the page and the page underneath to show through and interfere with your reading. For me this is not a huge problem, but for those with reduced eyesight it could be a issue. Everything else, however, is excellent about this New American Bible.",4,1

I was laughing by the time I got to chapter 3. Jamie McCoy's descriptions of what his daughter, Samantha, was doing or what he was going through was at times comical and you couldn't help but laugh. Nurse Allison wants to get involved with Jamie but knows that the &#34;other shoe&#34; is going to fall and he's going to try to send Samantha back to the mother who abandoned her on his back porch. She doesn't want to be involved with either one of them but she can't help herself.This book had me giggling right up until that shoe dropped. At that point I was a blubbering idiot. Read the book and see if you figure out just exactly where I broke and what caused me to break. As an aside you'll be able to read a couple of Jamie's regular newspaper columns and you'll find a lot of truth in them as well as get a chuckle.",4,1

3161810,AN EXCEPTIONAL ACCOUNT,"Be prepared to fall in love with a dog , a blind man and this book. Roselle is Mike's guide dog and friend. Mike, the author, is a person who, along with Roselle, helped people descend 78 floors of steps in the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. I learned much from this book. First, Mike helped us understand that the blind are more capable than we realize in taking care of themselves and achieving success in many of the arenas of their lives. Second, guide dogs are extraordinary companions who work hard for their owners. Roselle's temperament was docile and sweet. This was an asset in her important work. But these words do not really describe the impact of the book. It is powerful when the aspects I mention are seen together. With THUNDER DOG you'll find yourself saying, "" Oh you must read this book...""",5,1

Haunted Georgia details various haunted locations around Georgia, organizing the locations by city and type - creating a handy guide for someone to use if they are in Georgia and want to check out some haunted locations. Georgia is naturally teeming with (controversial)history and many of the historical structures exist and are still in use today. The author provides excellent historical background on the locations and descriptions of the hauntings, all with humorous commentary. I have heard of many of these hauntings (Savannah is particularly famous, as the majority of the buildings in the historic center are haunted), and can attest to the haunted rumors circulated by the residents described in the book.

The film was terrible, but Quattermain's character fascinated me: an African big game hunter, whom a local witch-doctor had blessed that Africa would never let him die. Quattermain has appeared in a number of books. filims, and serials, but this story marks his first.King's Solomon's Mines tells the story of the elephant hunter as he journeys in search of a secret kingdom, to recover a lost treasure and find a missing man. If the plot sounds familiar, that's because it is. But King's Solomon's Mines is not the copy; it is the predecessor to numerous other stories. Highly recommended.",5,1

6787312,Awesome little camera for the money and size - went into SPACE!,"Awesome. I sent this little guy up in a space balloon to 105K feet (20 miles high). It was partially exposed pointed directly up at the balloon. It was so cheap this was a ""bonus camera"" if it worked. At 100K feet there were 100 MPH winds and -50 degrees. The camera was partially exposed, but just taped in. In 2-3 ground tests I could never get more than 90 minutes out of it. In record mode it appears to save to memory every 30 minutes. If the power dies you lose whatever was in cache before the last save. I couldn't get the battery to last more than 120 minutes, so I only got 3 thirty minute files. For the balloon I got 99 minutes. Somehow it got bumped (??) and told to stop recording and it saved the last 9 minutes. We caught the balloon burst with just a minute to spare. Either way, this is an awesome little camera for the money. It is very simple to use and has its limitation (standard def), but it is smaller than a lipstick, so can be used in a lot of ways. Here is the balloon burst video:[...]",5,1

Screen protector film isn't really needed if the Kindle has a cover.As the price would suggest, this is a collection of generic items:  two adaptors that allow you to plug your Kindle into a car or wall socket (using your Kindle-to-USB cable), inexpensive earplugs, and a slime green wristband advertising the seller (CrazyOnDigital).

I rarely buy from an author with whom I'm not familiar until I've read the reviews An interesting observation: The reviewer from Atlanta questioned the author's sentence ( toward the beginning of the book ) - - - &#34; the apprentice writer will have less accidents.&#34;  The reviewer obviously missed the point; the correct word is 'fewer' accidents, not 'less' accidents. He thought the author made a mistake, actually intending to write that the apprentice writer would have 'more' accidents. The lesson from Mr. Elster concerned the correct use of the word 'fewer' in the sample sentence, instead of 'less'. - - Fewer accidents, not less accidents. I'm looking forward to reading Mr. Elster's book. From the few pages I've read, I know the experience will be delightful as well as ENLIGHTENING !",5,1

After you read it you will probably want to go back and learn about Terrible Timothy's earlier adventure and what the Inspector was like as a Sargent.

In an excellent repudiation of both NeoCons and Diversity worshippers, Buchanan traces the history of America's ascension and the planting of its seeds of destruction through the extension of empire and the promotion of the least productive elements of society at the expense of the most vital elements.  In light of his views, I am surprised that he doesn't recognize Ron Paul as the only leader able to get us on the right track.",5,1

I was super happy to be able to review this book.This book was breathtakingly beautiful. The love story between Diana and Gideon was amazing. The thing that I really enjoyed about this book was the struggle that Diana goes through after everything that happens. I really felt this was a very eye opening book. It really showed how one single event can really change a person. When writing about this subject matter I imagine it was a very hard book to write. I really commend this author for really showing what a woman possibly can go through after a traumatic experience like rape.This is defiantly a book that will touch your heart.,5,1

I have no idea why Comedy Central stopped the show regardless comments and requests posted by angry fans on the website.Anyway, previous reviews already reveal how good the show is. No need to address on that issue. One thing that I couldn't agree more is the about the DVD distributor. Like one of the previous previews points out that the distributor did poor job on making of the DVD. No special features, no subtitles, no delete scenes and no add-in values. Compare to those bootlegs DVDs sell on eBay, the only difference is one is legal and the other is not.The season one I just sold is because that. And those poor executions downgrade the marvelous title from a collection to a common DVD. Hate to give an outstanding product 4 star preview.

The little things I missed on the first one - specially the thrilling sensation of being right there with the protagonist instead of being told a story - are most definetely in place! I loved Elisa before, now I am in love with her. Her passion, humanity and determination to be the best person she can be at all times without being a goody two shoes exites me so much. The new depth of Hector, Mara, Bel&eacute;m, Storm the Invierno, and pretty much all characters Carson presented makes this one of the best books I have read in a long time. L-O-V-E-D it!",5,1

5275429,Ok mystery,"I really wanted to love this book. I found the secondary characters (especially Tuesday) more interesting than the Protagonist. The mystery was just so-so, as I had it figured out pretty early. Olivia really wasn't very likeable since I can't relate to someone who is shallow and superficial. She had an unhealthy relationship with her ex who was a horrifying caricature of a rich playboy. Her focus on clothing and name brands made her story about getting away from L.A. seem more like a plot device to get her into a smaller town than her trying to change her life and grow as a person. It was obvious she left because of the ex, and that made her seem wimpy. The Detective she is attracted to seemed dull and lifeless. I am glad I got this for free or I would have been upset by the poor writing and lack of editing.",2,0
3261338,a great adventure,"I really enjoyed this book, and would have given it 5 stars if not for 2 issues: it didn't pull me in at the begining (altho once it did I couldn't put it down) and those time jumps in the middle. I know the author was comparig it to Catch 22, but I didn't care for that book at all.  I know this book is certainly  not for everyone, but anybody who loves a good adventure is sure to love it. I highly recommend giving it a shot. The characters are great, the action and dialogue are well written and like I said, once you start its hard to put down.",4,1
2398831,Confessions of a Sisterhood Junkie...,"Ok, I admit it, I am a Sisterhood junkie. It is my guilty pleasure and I eagerly anticipate each and every installment. I'm not sure what it is, I'm usually not that big on revenge, but perhaps it is the way all of these very different ladies dish it out while dining on fine china, the best of foods and wines. Of course the characters and plots are outrageous and unrealistic, perhaps that is what makes them so much fun. The Sisterhood can now write their own ticket, even though they are in hiding. The imagination it took to create this group of Vigilantes just keeps on getting better. I usually find myself laughing out loud at least one time per book, usually more.I will say, I'm not sure how this book would read if you were not familiar with the books from the beginning of the Sisterhood series. For me, reading the first seven books would be a must to fully enjoy these latest ones.",5,1

9348540,Prometheus,"This movie ventures into the unknown allowing the viewer to bring up questions that are not intended to be answered. There is no set answer on where the origins of life came from. Fans of the Alien series best not go into the movie with expectations because you will be setting your selves up for disappointment. Ridley Scott did a fantastic job in creating a world that is creepy and at times thought provoking. Too often now films are hell bent on giving the answers to everything when its sometimes better to leave the film up to interpretation. I'm glad Prometheus was a story on its own, rather than being a direct prequel with aliens and face-huggers. The film requires more than one viewing and is best to watch multiple times to get a better understanding of the events that occur. If you go into the film with expectations you will be disappointed and will be cheating yourself to a thrill-ride that we have not seen in a science fiction film for a while. Give it a chance and take it in, you won't regret it.",5,1
2401973,Poor Anne of Cleves must be rolling in her grave!,"1.5 Stars. Poor Anne of Cleves must be rolling in her grave! This is a bad attempt at a sexy romp through The Tudor times. I was looking forward to a fresh prospective on Jane Boleyn and hoping for a researched story on her life and why she made the cruel decisions she did. Instead the author follows Tudor cliches and the new insight she added was purely fictional and to me...ridiculous ""I mean come on Anne of Cleves and Kat Howard doing the nasty? Not to mention Jane and **** hooking up."" If I knew nothing about this time period I might have thought this was a fun romp through medieval times, instead this was simply ridiculous.",2,0

His retelling of ""the Final Solution"" fills in plot holes in the original and ends the book in a very satisfying fashion.  Highly recommended.",5,1

3450400,Out standing,"I just finished the book and I enjoyed it not just because it was a great book but why I think so. First most World War II fiction novels have the main character(s) being a officer(s), not this book the main characters are Sergeants. As a retired Army NCO this made me feel good. The author said at the end of the book the Horton aircraft is real and the German Atomic Bomb program was too. The other thing I enjoyed was the fact that while the two NCO's  and their troops were competing against each other, when it came time for a mission they were one team, as it should be. This makes another of the 99 cent books that to me is much better than many that cost me much more. Since this book ends not long after the Normandy landings I hope the author has a sequal in mind. Well done.",5,1
5756648,Rhino Gets Its Hands Dirty...,"...daring to release a huge 15 volume set of New Wave/No Wave music from the late 70's thru the 80's.  Most of the songs on this first volume should probably better be called &quot;postpunk&quot; than &quot;new wave&quot;,  but let's not get hung up on words.  The first five tracks make this album  worth the money alone - Blondie's stellar &quot;One Way or Another&quot;,  Plastic Bertrand's one shining moment &quot;Ca Plane Pour Moi&quot; and so  forth.  The rest of the album is perhaps spottier - hitting notable highs  (&quot;Money (That's What I Want)&quot;, &quot;Video Killed the Radio  Star&quot;) and some not-so-highs (&quot;I Do the Rock&quot;, where Tim  Curry sounds like he's trying really hard to be cool).  An excellent start  to an excellent series.  Odd note - this series doesn't contain the Depeche  Mode song &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; on it...but then again, EMI's  LIVING IN OBLIVION series didn't contain the Anything Box song &quot;Living  in Oblivion&quot;.

I was able to finish reading it, but it did not leave me wanting more. One of the biggest detractors for me was the very ""English"" terms that you had to figure out the meaning of. The foul language was a little off-putting as well.For a book with a title of Beach Street Knitting Society and Yarn Club, I really expected more about knitting, the knitting group/yarn club and yarn store. It seemed like they were more an afterthought. There were characters that seemed interesting, but needed to be more fleshed out. I would not buy/read a sequel.For knitters looking for a novel about knitting, look elsewhere.",2,0

In the beginning of the book, English was so badly used that I thought a couple of characters had foreign accents.  Because I don't like to stop reading a book without finishing it, I continued.

His life and death are the basis for the world's greatest religion and by sticking to the facts of that, it is indeed a religious account.

7007397,Exceptional,"I upgraded to this from a Forerunner 110 because I gave up on that watch's fragile (non-replaceable) wrist-band. My only regret is not getting this watch sooner. Using the bezel took a bit of getting used to, but after the first few tries I found it incredibly convenient and intuitive. Satellite acquisition times are noticeably faster than with my 110 even with lots of buildings around me and overcast skies. As an added bonus, the wristband is user-replaceable and it ships with an extra set. Finally, from an aesthetic perspective, the watch is great for everyday use without drawing much attention. Though it is by no means small, it doesn't look out of place on my average wrist either (unlike some of the other GPS watches out there).",5,1

6531906,Good cable but cat5 is obsolete--spend a few dollars for a cat6 cable.,A LAN/ethernet cable will always beat wireless in speed AND security--and Amazon prices are less than half the cost at any discount store you are likely to find--but--by the same token Cat6 cables via Amazon are so cheap you might as well spend a bit more and get the best--whether you need it right now. Just read the reviews and make sure you get a &#34;genuine&#34; cat6 cable.,1,0

6968941,Great Cables,Simply the best HDMI cables I have run across! Even at twice the price I'd buy these. Plenty of flexibility for my needs and the outer woven sheathing is really tough! Signal quality is outstanding! Why pay the ridiculously over-inflated prices some other brick-and-morter stores are asking...?,5,1

2239303,"Day-dreaming, 35 years ago","This book just came from Amazon today so I haven't read it yet. But I  wanted to share with you what I was most delighted with when I opened the  book. I must have been day-dreaming when the teacher taught the rule of Y.  All these years, I'm 46, I never new when to leave the Y and add s, or drop  the Y and add ies. In fact, that rule was one of the reasons I bought the  book. You can imagine how happy I was when the first page I turned to was  the very rule I was looking for--the rule of Y. I can't wait to get into  the section on commas.After skimming through the book, I saw many rules  that I have forgotten, but that, Joanne Feierman, has resurrected into a  fun easy way to remember. I doubt I'll ever forget the rule of Y from now  on. You know, when I think about it, there was probably a good reason why I  was day-dreaming thirty-five years ago.",5,1

So, that Dan 'Wolf' Wolford is all that, plus likes dogs, and is a super sexy fireman - what's not to like about SANTA WORE LEATHERS?Ms. Davis packs so much heart, romance, and humor into each page, I couldn't have closed the book on Wolf and Becca even if I'd wanted to.

This is particularly valuable given the competitiveness of the current job market and the lack of ""replacement jobs"". The jobs we have lost likely will NOT be returning, and a new way of thinking about the job search is critical. This book will help you get there - and the information about re-positioning yourself and your skills to make you a stronger candidate is excellent advice for those searching.",5,1

It really gives readers a good glimpse into the male mind, including their thoughts and views on dating, relationships, and love. This book provides great detail on how to make a man fall in love with you from the initial first date to creating an ever-lasting relationship. Among many great tips outlined in this book, it gives thorough information on how to present your best self, how to be aware of red flags that a man is not ready to be in a relationship, and explains key characteristics of what a man is looking for in a mate, etc., etc.! I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for true love.",5,1
627345,cookie,This was a cute and nice christmas love story. I enjoyed seeing the main character declare her love for the guy at his wedding that took guts and even though their time had yet to come. I was rooting for them to get together. I enjoyed getting to know the people in this town and the women in the cookie club.,4,1
5387501,Second best,Not the best by this author but a good read.  Don't know who is responsible for editing the book before print but not a good job on this one.  I like the character Jess Williams and he is always involved in some action.  It is worth buying.,4,1

5783441,Coming of age,"From the first eerie notes of &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; I knew that this was going to be vastly different than their first album. What is this? All these songs are dwelling on murder, on fear? What else is this? They are making use of a real drummer! Kudos for that! The songs are like no other the band has made. I'm not sure what led the band into the outer rim of hell, but they certainly came back with a macabre, dark treat. Each song has some underlying darkness (if it isn't obvious), yet they pull it off without making you want to off yourself in the end. From start to finish this is a great great record. High points: I'VE BEEN LOSING YOU, OCTOBER, THE WEIGHT OF THE WIND, THE SWING OF THINGS.",5,1
8383981,M's Review,"We were given this book in exchange for an honest reviewCharlie and Callums life was going perfect, at least that is what he thought. Charlie on the hand hated it. She only got the weekend to spend with him and even then he was always on his phone.I knew the whole time he was hiding something.  But what he was hiding was so horrible when she found out. I wanted to strangle him through my kindle. Im glad Charlie walked away. She needed to find herself even though I did think she needed to hear his side.After some time passes Callum finally gets Charlie to listen. When his story is done, I was left sitting there thinking.. holy sh!t did that really just happen? Some of it was a little over the top but I also get why it was so much.Is Charlie and Callum's love strong even through all the turmoil?4 stars",4,1
504242,Almost Like Being in Love,If there was ever a book that deserved more than 5 stars this is it. Not only was it one of the sweetest love stories ever but so funny I was laughing out loud through out the whole book. I could rave about this book so much but I could never do it justice. If you haven't read it yet then your missing out. It is so worth the time and money.,5,1
5242471,Hmmmm.... I could be at a bakery in New York's Little Italy,"I don't think this book missed much, although little centered around the pistachio. Clear, concise and most importantly, inspiring! I read the negative comments, then decided that the price reduced the risks and downloaded it. I wonder if someone missed the title. For Italian desserts, it is spot on.",5,1

2089674,Good follow up with surprises,"Nice followup to book one.  Different concept.  While book one was concerned with the concept of over-control of health care by government, book two involves setting up a new colony.  Tense moments.  Clever geographical concept and surprise motives.",4,1
5340922,"Original, well-crafted thriller","This is an original and well-written story. It does require substantial suspension of disbelief, but the voice was so strong, I had no problems with that. Unlike many e-books, 3 a.m. is fairly well edited. However, there is one malapropism that diminishes the ""big reveal"" at the end, when we are told who made the all-important autonomous--as compared to anonymous--phone call.The bonus preview of the author's next book was a delightful surprise. And I'm inclined to read it, too.Good, job, Mr. Pirog!",4,1

3391489,"Terrible, Awful, Horrible, No Good, Waste of Time & Money!!!!","This book sucked, and not in some profound, horribly sad way. It was crap. 435 pages of garbage. The ONLY part of this book that held my attention was the end, and it didn't do so for long. I'm now sitting here, kicking myself for forcing my poor brain to trudge through this hogwash. The story is long and drawn out and the writer has no talent. Never in my life have I picked up a book with such monotonous detail, page after page after flipping page, it never changes! I wish there was the option to give this a 0 star rating. I am sitting here trying to figure out what is mentally wrong with the people who could in good conscience give this book ANYTHING over a 1 star rating!Maya and Lochan are brother and sister.

2088137,Brutal but So Real,"Sometimes when the story is so powerful, we forget that it can be so real.  Turned Out From Ethiopia happens to be one of those stories and it is told so well in this book.  Actually, the story is so well done and raw, that it makes me mad.I had to read the book in bits in pieces, even though I could have had the book done in a single sitting, because of the subject.  I think it is written very well though and I like that everything is laid out for the reader and none of the details are smoothed over.  Very well done and I think people need to read this because we kind of just go about our day oblivious to what is happening all around us.",4,1

1471365,Not as good as the first one...,"This book wansn't that bad, but when you compare it to the first one (written about the heroine's parents) it is a disappointment.  What happened?  The hero is kind, but I didn't like the heroine at all.  She had  absolutely no redeeming qualities; in fact she refused to be sorry for any  of the problems she caused for other characters.  I look forward to another  sequel in the story, but I hope Lindsey takes a little more time with it  than she did with this one.",2,0

6641677,Almost perfect,"It really is compatible with the iphone...Yippee!!  Sound is clear.  It even has enough bass, which is more than I can say for my other pair of Shure E3s.  My only beef would be the lack of a clip for the mic.  I find it dangles kind of far, past my shoulder, and I'm often concerned about the other party not hearing me.  But then again, I've never had a complaint from the other end either.  Anyway, I now carry a mini butterfly clamp with me so I can clip the mic by my collar.  It doesn't bother me that the mic doesn't have an on/off switch; I just answer and end calls from the phone.  I mean how far can the phone be...it's not like it's bluetooth.  All in all, I'm very pleased with the sound quality of this headset.",4,1

6299920,Runs a bit small,I had the Cumulus 12 shoes about a year ago in size 10.5W and they were massive (I had to give them away because I tried hard to like them by wearing them for a couple weeks).  This time around I ordered down to a 10W in the Cumulus 13.  They are on the small side.  I wore them 3 times for runs and each time my foot felt crowded and would get tingly or numb- even with super loose laces.  I pulled out the inserts and saw that they were super thick and took up excessive space. It looked like the inserts were an after thought which made these wides into a narrow average shoe.  I dropped in some thin inserts I happen to have.  The shoes actually feel like a normal wide width now!  I've worn them on a few runs and they feel absolutely great now... I don't even think about the comfort of my shoes when I'm running-- which is what I want.,4,1
5480063,thumbs down,I didn't like the writing style of the author.  It felt like she was trying to hard to be sexy and dominant.  The female lead spent to much time talking to others.  The males was closed mouth about his past and that came off as childish.,1,0

7824092,Very Nice Slow Cooker!,"I bought this Crock-Pot for my son and his wife for Christmas but gave it to them early as they were entertaining another son who was visiting at Thanksgiving.  My son cooked a 6 or 7 lb Pork Roast for pulled pork.  It worked beautifully!  Some complain about it being hot on the outside.  Well, Yeah!!!  Don't touch the sides!  lol  All crockpots are hot on the outside.  Hence the heating of the crock on the inside. :-) I highly recommend this pot.  My son likes the controls and this is the biggest pot I've ever seen.  I have three sizes and this one is bigger than my big one.  You can trust this brand!",5,1
1618153,Page turner,"Hard to believe a book about a cable TV network could be so interesting. As a long time fan of the Food Network, I found this book fascinating. The stories of its early days and its evolution were very enlightening and explained a lot of things I had often wondered about. The best parts were the descriptions of the stars, how they came to be and their relationship to the network. Sadly Food Network's treatment of some of its people such as Emeril was pretty shoddy. The book slows down some in the final chapters but all-in-all is a very good read. I couldn't put it down.",5,1

2027955,"Exciting, Creative, Sci-Fi page-turner","Stephenson dreams up an elaborate and twisty story set in a fascinating near-future world.  I kept compulsively turning the pages as all the sub-plots folded together into the, gradually revealed, overall story.  The background world is just as interesting as the story and Stephenson creatively describes a post-nation state world based on nanotechnology (I suspect that somebody more versed in the technology might have gotten more out of all the technology talk than a layman like me).  One warning, Stephenson doesn't stop to explain the new technology, culture, or terminology.  Rather, he just throws out terms and concepts and everything is gradually explained.  I suspect that some readers could be frustrated by this approach.",5,1

(Art Chateau)Sad that a lady who liked her privacy was drug out in the public after her death. what a shame........The book was written so well. took sometime to get into it. but it was a very educational read. and interesting.sad that she was so generous and some seemed to have taken advantage of her. she just couldn't say no. but she wasn't going to be able to take her riches with her. so she did with her money and wealth as she saw fit. who are we to question what she did.

4032765,"well, I finished it!","I realized I wasn't that impressed with the book when I was skipping through entire chapters. In my opinion Peaches was too much of a tramp. From me that's a big deal. She pretty much jumps at anything that looks at her. I liked the main male character, Dalton. I just had to skip a lot to get to him. This book started with a great premise, but, I only finished it because of how much it cost. I would not recommend this book series to anyone.",2,0

Ianni is like a child experiencing the world and her emotions for the first time in a very unchild-like body. This novella does a wonderful job of connecting its readers with Ianni's new experiences and feelings, and by the end readers will feel Ianni is one of their closest friends as well. A great edition to the series, sure to leave readers waiting impatiently for the next book.",5,1
1636141,LOVE this book! Original and charming!,"I wanted this book as soon as I saw it and read about the content; what a great idea! Complaining crayons! We go through all the colors in the box and share their unhappiness when they send a batch of letters to their owner Duncan. He reads all of them and comes up with a magical solution which is shown toward the end. Along the way we meet various crayons and read about their individual complaints and though I found all of them to be funny and witty, my favorite was poor Peach who was afraid (and embarrassed!)to come out of the box since Duncan removed her wrapper! This book is simply brilliant and the illustrations are fantastic! This book can (and should) be given to kids everywhere for birthdays, holidays or just because, it is that special. No child should without one!",5,1

It's a familiar scenario: the world is falling apart and only our hero can battle the elements and save it.  Except this is a bit different, told with a Russian twist.  Well done.  The Burning Lake is the third in the series - all are worth an evening's escapist reading.",4,1
3753967,ALMOST upset there isn't a book 3!! :-),"Book 2 was just as riveting as Book 1!  These books are definitely in my favorite list and I am already reading them again.  I was irritated enough to have some angst but not to the point of wanting to stop reading all together.  There is a lot of drama and just when you think things are sorted out - BAM - more issues!  But, it is written in a way that keeps you mesmerized and wanting more.  As I said in the review of Book 1 (Fall From Grace) - there is humor, sadness, drama, suspense, romance - this series has it all.  I was ALMOST upset that this the last book because I could have kept reading about not only Shane and Grace but about the rest of the group, but was happy to not have a cliffhanger!  Very happy to have stumbled on to these and hope to see more by this author!",5,1

What we found, ultimately was that Joy also experienced fear. He was scared someone would not want to be his friend. (of course he was wrong!)This book, full of colorful, unique characters and a myriad of challenges and adventures is a great book for kids of all ages. It is especially good when trying to teach our children to act on courage, or how to be good friends to one another. (there are a TON of learning moments in this book-especially if parent is reading to child!) I highly recommend adding this book to your family &#34;library&#34; and reading this to your kids or having them read it themselves. Through its good example, it is also a great book to read that demonstrates the opposite of bullying.",5,1

Furthermore, the characters are all cold and the audience cannot embrace sympathy.  Thumbs down.",2,0
5718165,All their albums are great...this one is the best.,"I have listened to The Smiths since the beginning and have all they released in original format...and many compilations as well.  'The Queen is Dead' is a solid choice for the novice or curious as you will not be disappointed and will desire the next album.  Radio play songs, ala KROQ and 91X, include 'Big Mouth Strikes Again' and 'There is a Light'.  My personal favorites are the title track...The Queen is Dead, Cemetery Gates,I Know It's Over, and Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others.

What I really wonder about this album in connection with the one they shelved and then released for free on their website is why they didn't just put the other good material with this material making it a solid album of songs instead of a very short one with few good ones.

4244280,A Great Read From the Dedication to The End,"Rachel Hauck's masterful writing invites you to sit down and partake of the world of food, cooking shows, chefs and the oh-so-tangled web woven by one faux chef, Joy Ballard--of Dining with Joy fame.Dining with Joy is more than a story about ""foodies""--it delves into what food means to different people--how food can show love, or represent family, or can even divide families.I stayed up until 1:30 a.m. to finish the book because I fell in love with Joy and Luke, the main characters--and so enjoyed watching them fall in love. I kept turning pages because I wondered, ""What's going to happen next?"" Even the subplot of the book is compelling enough to make you wonder what you would say or do if you were in Joy.I can't wait to go back and re-read my favorite parts. The challenge is going to be figuring out what those favorite parts are--I have so many!",5,1

2166577,Thoughtful and voyeuristic,"This book jumped into my hands a few days ago, and I couldn't put it down. It's not that the plot twists and turns or that the characters are so riveting--though they are, it was just a very beautifully told story.  Soft and quiet, like a stream to sit by, compelling in the most understated way.  I'm not Catholic, but who hasn't been intrigued by the life of a monk?  Growing up on the Canadian border (Buffalo) I was very comfortable and familiar with the French-Canadian theme, if not the religious aspects.  I was very taken by the humanity of these people, not saintly and overly pious as I had imagined.  Not completely sure of their choices and convictions, any more than any of us are.  I simply loved this book and will be sharing it with many friends who may at first glance find it an odd selection.  I highly recommend it not only for the rare glimpse of a rare life it offers, but for the questions it provokes in one's own life.  I will be looking for future works by this author.",5,1

9435842,"Review of the first episode ""genesis""","The first episode of the season is an extremely interesting and unusual bit of television. It simultaniously provides both the beginning and the possible ending of the title character. Richard Boone plays two parts which are essentially his younger and older self confronting each other. Its well written and quite original.The Paladin character is a former west point officer and civil war veteran. He is from an important family but falls into disgrace and is eventually paid by his family not to go home. To stay away. He falls into a life of dueling, gambling and mercenary work. The episode shows the character hitting rock bottom in his youth, confronting his mistakes years later and possibly reaching a sort of redemption late in life. Whats so good aboutthe episode is that explains the character in an allegorical  way rather than a literal one. The answers it offers are meaningful answers rather than trivia.William Conrad both directs and plays a role in the episode.",5,1
9243564,The Blind Side,"Truly this is one of the best stories of our day. It is so great to know that there are people who live their lives in service to others, and that they are willing to get out of their comfort zones to do it!

4251299,An important contribution to the literature,"So long as 800,000+ people are arrested for marijuana cases ALONE, every year, and so long as those sent to prison for drugs are predominantly black and poor, and so long as court time costs over $1000 an hour, and so long as prison time costs from $15-35K a year, mass incarceration remains a luxury America can no longer afford.Ms. Alexander, Paul Butler, Paul Craig Roberts, and many others have written about the problems with the Prison Industrial Complex, and the way it has destroyed entire communities.  This book is an important contribution to that literature.  I fear that it will only be read by those who already ""get it,"" and that those who really need to understand will never see it.",5,1
4782352,Same author?,"I bought this book because I enjoyed ""Tall Dark and Lonely.""  I did not enjoy this book nearly as much.  Very little seemed to actually happen, large amounts of it were just re-iterating the same thoughts over and over again.  Several new characters were introduced that, at the time, felt like they just interrupted the story.  The character of Chris, who I liked very much in the first book, was a jerk throughout most of this book and seemed to go against everything that was described in the first one. There were also ALOT more mistakes in this book - grammatical, punctuation, repeating phrases in the middle of a sentence.  I don't know if the author was rushed, or what, but if this were the first book and not the third one I've read of hers, I wouldn't have continued.",2,0

I want to give them to everyone I know. I even tried to convince the office manager at my work to get them for the sink in the break room.Our previous sink strainers had those little plungers, which were always engaging all on their own, which would mean that the sink was always plugged up when I didn't want it to be. They also got really nasty really fast, with slime and gook building up between the metal and rubber parts. They are gone, out of my life forever!",5,1

2508875,Tells It Like It Is!,"This is the most scriptural book I have read on Christian living.  Tenny reveals exactly what is missing in today's lukewarm Church.  For too long we have been like the church of Laodicea.  We are content and believe ourselves to be rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.  We have no idea that we are &quot;wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.&quot; (Revelation 3:17)  We know there has got to be more.  Does it make sense that there is no bread in the house of bread?  Can a living man see the face of God?  It is time to submit to God's way of living.  God wants a personal relationship with us.  Crucify the flesh!  Get out of your comfort zone!  Let your soul follow hard after God.This book appears to be written from a Pentecostal (or Charismatic, if you prefer) point of view, but it speaks of all Christians today.  We must seek a deeper relationship with God.  We must seek His face, not his hands.  Don't let Satan blind you any longer!",5,1

The story takes you to another world and the characters are really pleasant. I could relate to the characters in this story and really liked them. This is a good read and is well written.

7010767,Runs better than the HD 5870 I had earlier,"Replaced a broken 5870 with this 6870 and I am pretty happy (the 5870 is supposed to be faster than the 6870, for those of you who didn't know).  This runs MUCH quieter and at from what I have seen the same speeds.  I never hear the fan go on.  It does not run cooler, however, than the 5870.  I also noticed that if you enable ATI overdrive the idle clock speed goes up to 300mhz instead of 100mhz which seems wasteful when you are not playing games.  I overclocked it by 50mhz on the core and 35mhz on the memory without doing anything, which was nice.  Other than that, you basically will be able to play anything you throw at it that is out there today.  Crysis Warhead still has some hiccups, but the 5870 had them too when it wasn't blue screening.This is definitely the best bang for your buck that you can get at the moment.

738323,A View in an Ash-Tinted Mirror,"This story is about, and for, people who have good intentions but who don't know how to carry them through.This book is about me.If you've ever found yourself in a dilemma where you told yourself that you didn't know what The Right Thing to Do was, while suspecting in the back of your mind that you really did know what you should do but just couldn't admit that you did, then this story will strike a responsive chord, or several.Most books have lead characters who are either clearly heroes or villains.  In better books these characters are humanized and believable, but they're still either heroes or villains.  This book has a hero/villain too; the difference is that his 'villain-ness' is part of his 'heroism'!  No one but Anne Tyler could have pulled this off, but she does so brilliantly.If you've ever doubted yourself, wondered about your motivations, confessed your sins to yourself and then absolved yourself of them-- then reading this book will be like staring deeply at youself in an ash-colored mirror.",5,1

They simply send out replacement screen protectors within a few days.They are easy to apply and last forever.  I've had the same screen protector on a Nexus 7 for 2 years and going on 6 months for my iPhone 5s.  Yes, they will scratch because they PET but that's why TechArmor gives you 2 or 3 in each pack.I've found that the best place to install them is in the bathroom after someone has take a hot shower.

2669037,Study Bible needs more notes,"The Lutheran Study Bible is fine as far as it goes.  However, I would like to have had more - and more extensive - margin notes.

I just wish there were more to it!",4,1

2283732,This Book Is On Target..,"This book was never intended to be a Theology lesson on every church out there.  It is a well organized topically given exercise of who the Christian Churches are.  Frome whom were they spawned?  What are their beliefs based on Historical and Creedal Precedents (statements) and that's all it is meant to accomplish.  Perhaps if Mr. Rhodes wishes to make use of some literary criticism whereby some here have chosen to pass on him and maybe in his next version of this book he may choose to give a broader depiction with a better Prologue and Commentary area.  But a book about Denominations is just that.  A book that tells us as factually as can be sought out through preserved data of who, what and where these churches have come from and what do they believe.  No reason for a scholarly lesson on ""is this church' teachings this or that and why or why not"" is needed!  That is not this book's intent.

8147214,"Great for newbies, veterans will still learn something","This was a great little book. I particularly liked the list of plug-ins that the author uses, and though I already knew about many of them there were some new gems for my list. This book is probably the best for people who are new to WordPress, but old hands will also learn something.",4,1
7537313,AWESOME!!,"I read a bunch of the reviews before ordering this, and based on some of the problems, I almost didn't go ahead with the purchase.  I am glad I took the leap, because this was awesome to use!  I didn't experience any of the grease or metal flakes that others did. at. all.I DID follow one person's suggestion to initially clean this with vodka, and maybe that's why I didn't see grease or flakes?  Either way, I was happy with the results of the pasta this made, and the ease of which it helped me make it.  The *only* complaint was that the recipes were way off in timing of the mixing of the pasta dough.  I had to run the dough with the dough hook on 2 for almost 8 minutes to develop the gluten enough to roll out right.Overall, very happy with the shipping speed and packaging as well.  This is a well made product that I am expecting to use for some time to come.",5,1

1286673,disappointed,"I am a big Anne Perry fan.  I really enjoyed the first book in this series.

926593,I feel I was conned,Not at all what I expected.  I was looking forward to an easy to follow story of a man getting revenge on the con men.  This took too many branches of history of con men for me to follow.  I was very disappointed and gave up trying to follow it all.,2,0

5474033,Firecracker in the making!,I like this installment!  This was an interesting short story on how Trixie was like before she became Firecracker.  Trixie wasn't so aggressive. She was cautious and not so daring.  She cared about not wanting to mess up or ruin anything.  The build up to the very hot parts was really interesting.  Just seeing Trixie progressing to a little of the needy and aggressive makes really good reading!,5,1
2764632,Kill Shot,I really enjoy the Mitch Rapp series.  I have read everyone of Vince Flynn's books and continue to be a fan.  I like to lose myself in the stories as they always have plenty of suspense and action.,4,1
9282561,Great lesson for all ages!,"This script may not live up to the book (I can't answer that as I haven't had the pleasure of reading the book...YET), but in itself, I think it's a winner!We ran into it be accident and have watched it at least 4 times since Saturday afternoon.  My 6 year old LOVES it.  Some mild violence and peril, but all turns out well in the end.  For a second I thought the ending would be too much for a 6 year old.  Maria jumps into the ocean to sacrifice for her family, but within seconds, she is rescued by a beautiful unicorn and the end is magically and nicely tied up.  The music is beautiful as well.As a parent, I loved the lessons of forgiveness AND being able to say you are sorry.  Excessive pride can lead to ruin, as this movie shows.I plan on purchasing the book and reading it with my daughter.  I am sure she will enjoy it as much as she did the movie.",4,1

1014075,The Supremes At Earls All You Can Eat,"What a surprising wonderful story of 3 life long friends and the journey of life played out in a little town surrounded by a local diner called Earl's All You Can Eat. I loved the way the author introduced the characters and weaves their personal stories through life's progression allowing love, laughter, pain, healing to unfold naturally.  ( TP member)",5,1
1903830,Enjoyable.,"I was expecting something light, humorous and somewhat meaningless like the movie about losing a guy in 10 days. I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a very candid, detailed, well thought out, easy-to-read story of a down to earth person. I found her life story (up to the age of 30) interesting and engaging even if she isn't a superhero or a celebrity. I probably would not have purchased this book new, but I'm glad I got a chance to read it because I did enjoy it.",4,1
2491734,There are no endings...,"Reading this was bittersweet... Sanderson has shown that he's well able to enter and share Jordan's WoT universe.  I've been waiting for this book since I read the second one (since the first was basically able to stand alone).  Using Robert Jordan's outline, notes and written scenarios for this ending.  This book left me both satisfied and ambivilant; satisfied, because the ending of the series leaves the reader with the answers to most of the questions and storylines introduced... ambivilant, because the series that I've been reading now for over 20 years is over.  Time to read it again from the start, I suppose!",5,1
793710,Incredible,"This book is what classic literature should be: not merely showy or philosophical, but also a great pleasure to read. I was riveted the whole time. The narrator is fantastic and I'd put him right up there with Jim Dale, my other favorite reader/actor.",5,1
7828279,I've had for a year and still like it.,"It cleans really, really well. It's easy to empty & clean out. It comes with an extra filter (washable), so you can switch out & not have to wait for the other one to dry before vacuuming.  I had a problem getting it to come back on one time after cleaning the filters because I didn't have it put back together all the way properly. Be sure you click each piece back in to place all the way. I use it for carpets (the rotating carpet head with light & adjustable height is great) and then switch to the hard floor head/attachment to do my tile & wood floors. I like that the controls are on the handle where your hand is. It's been good to me so far. Grateful for the retractable cord, extending/telescoping wand. Wish it had a round brush attachment for dusting, though.",5,1
1277120,Did Salvatore fish this out of a dumpster?,"This was without a doubt, THE WORST book I have ever read!The author had NO feel for the characters, NO familiarity in the SW genre, and frankly NO writing style.You killed Chewie.  How dare you just waltz into a genre that you don't belong in and kill off one of the best characters?And what is with the Vong?  Did he even READ anything about the nature of the Force?  Life creates the Force.  The Vong shouldn't be invisible on in, if anything they should RADIATE the Force since everything they have is biological in nature.Ugh, this was just so terrible, I had to FORCE myself to finish reading it.Do yourself a favor and pass this one by.",2,0

9457650,One of her Best ever!,"This video was outstanding.  I have another walking video of Denise's called &#34;Blast Away the Pounds, Indoor Walk&#34;.  It was pretty good but this one is much better in many ways.  It moves quickly from move to move keeping it interesting.  Her cuing and transitions are much better than in some of her earlier videos.  It is really a great workout.  I was surprised how I sweat.  The extra 10 minutes of ab exercises were a great addition.  I have some other walking videos from a popular trainer and I like this one so much better because it is not monotonous!  I have nearly all of Denise's videos and this is definitely one of her best!",5,1

I listen to my mp3 with these as well and don't mind the trade off of lesser sound quality for comfort and convience.I sometimes forget I am wearing them...they are that comfortable.Can wear em in the rain here in Seattle with no worries because they don't have  foam construction.  Really like the way they stay put. I gave up on all those other models that are supposed to fit in your ear.  They never did and was frustrated the way kept falling out.Not these Sony's.

648394,The color YELLOW,"Louise Erdrich has written many books that I have read in past 30 years. Seems to me, this book takes a political stand that confuses me. Growing up in Dakota, National Geographic influenced many of us and it is not rare that Ojibwes have paucity of words. Germans on the other hand, may want the world to know the greatness of thier heritage. Louise can say little and mean much. We are all better because she wrote about Joe who ate  one of those peanut butter and dill pickle sandwiches on an ordinary day that changed the world and we can read about it in her latest book. There may be many a Minnesota man who listened to Battlestar Galactia every evening before supper.",5,1
8587446,Angelina Jolie at her finest,"This was an outstanding film of the highest quality. The acting was Oscar quality performances from start to finish. Production quality was good. The story is engaging, vivid, sexual and dark. There is full frontal nude shots so it is not a movie for the very young or very prudish. This movie pulls you in and makes you feel involved in the twisted world of a model superstar. Buy this film and add it to your collection if you like raw truth type films with a twisted sexual feel.",5,1

1264018,This is my 16 year old sons review.,"I read this book and it is the best book I have ever read. I have read a lot of books in my time, but none can compete. This is a classic that everyone should have to read. It is a love story mixed in with action and no shortage of clever wording. Piers Anthony knows how to phrase things perfectly and get your mind moving - questioning what he will write next. I have written and published a book, but I can only dream to  write one this amazing. He personified death, along with the other incarnations, better than I could have hoped for. I had been taking the book day by day, reading a chunk a night, but when I got to 60% completion, I couldn't stop reading it! I thought I would be tired the next morning, but I jumped out of bed, proud that I had finished such a great book. It had been recommended by my step-dad who said it changed his life when he was my age.It is definitely a life-changing book and if you are reading this, do not take that sentence lightly. Any man can learn from and enjoy this book.",5,1

3136929,Excellent,I highly recommend this book!!  The characters are developed in such a way the th tend to reflect a true life into themselves.

1822680,Enjoyable read,"This is another instance of the Kindle Daily Deal giving me the chance to discover an author I was not previously familiar with.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am now reading the 2nd book in the trilogy.  The Kindle Daily Deal doesn't often appeal to me, but when it does, I am usually pleased with the book.  The only problem is...in cases such as The Physician, where I get a great book at an excellent price, if I want to read the sequel or the next book in a series, the subsequent books are full price, which is too often the same price for the e-book as for a hard copy.  I will never understand why e-books cost as much as hard copies, given the significantly lower cost to produce.",5,1

1916096,Language Lover,"I'm currently taking a Spanish class and have found this to be a very useful tool.  All the text is black and white  but it is very clearly printed and the words you're looking up are in bold print.  Love the size, fits well in my purse.  Also has a useful grammar section in the middle including a mini conjugation guide.  Also love the material that the cover is made of and actually purchased this particluar dictionary because it had a ""turtleback"" cover instead of paperback.  It's kind of like a plastic that you could easily wipe off if it gets dirty.  My only complaint is that when my instructor asked me to look up a word that should have given me ""shower head"" it said watering can, but everyother time I've looked up a word it has been accurate and 90% of the time it does have the word I'm looking for (my level is intermediate-three years in highschool and this is the second semester long college course I have taken, the first was 10 years ago.)",4,1

The only thing missing is an accompanying video to WATCH Dion flailing her  fists around like King Kong.",1,0
8421588,Another great book!,"I have never yet been disappointed by any of Mr. Owens' books, including this one.  As usual, I couldn't put it down, so I was almost late for work this morning.  :-)  I highly recommend this book!",5,1
1067728,The Anti-Hemingway novel,"Sparse on dialogue and heavy on description, the novel paints an impressionistic picture of Italy and the world the protagonist lives in and comes to love. Written in the first person, it reads as a memoir. The pace is slow, however, making it tedious reading toward the middle. If you've seen the movie adaptation, The American, this is... slower. Nice read, but not a page turner.",4,1

5431696,Didn't live up to the description,"There really wasn't a plot; Pearl becomes a whiny, insecure female--actually all the characters seemed a bit too unbelievable.  It didn't seem to be enough to drag this out into a series--even if it did seem to end abruptly.  Wish I had read all the reviews.  On the plus side it was either free or .99 so I guess I got what I paid for.",1,0

3383343,Another worthwhile read from King,"Loved the relationship between Dan and Abra and their interesting connection.  They dynamic within her family was well done, parents dealing with a child with &#34;special&#34; abilities.  Not unlike dealing with an autistic or special needs child I imagine...  Although Dan didn't have any family left he cobbled together one that meant a lot to him and gave him peace.  Not too predictable either which was good.",4,1

Highly recommended for anyone needing a CD wallet for any reason.",5,1

1620685,"Couldn't put it down, so nice to read something with Australia as location. Just brilliant.","Another beautifully written book by liane moriarty, it was filled with words that were so descriptive that I felt like I knew them all. It's had twists and changes that I found fascinating, life in the suburbs isn't always a bed of roses. The challenges each person faced and how they handled them was exactly as it would be in real life. I thoroughly enjoyed every chapter. I am really enjoying her other books which are all so different but just as mysterious and exciting. I would highly recommend this author.",5,1

821720,Wordsmithing at its finest,"Though this book came recommended, I worried that it might reek of the pseudo-spirituality of something like the Alchemist. Or that the story might be dull as that of something like the Historian. The beginning is indeed a little slow, which might put off some readers.But though this book received a lot of praise, it might not have received enough.  It's one of the very best of the decade; a story involving every emotion and told from a master wordsmith.  There aren't enough superlatives to describe this book; it's one of the few I've ever been genuinely sorry to finish.",5,1
4839613,Very Enjoyable read,I enjoyed reading this book. The female lead was strong and determined. I found myself laughing out loud in a few scenes. The male lead was just the right degree of mean. When I read good books like this I often wonder what happen to the couple and friends and love when author write a series. I bought this book from the reviews and was not disappointed.,4,1
9329381,Family Friendly,"Again, I feel iCarly is a great show for the whole family.  Haven't experienced any &#34;awkward&#34; moments while watching with the kids.  Good old fashion fun.  Leaves the unnecessary out.  Enjoyable without sex or violence!  Highly recommend for family viewing.",5,1

852906,Execellent Crime/Mystery Thriller,"It saddened me to know that Larsson passed away several years ago and there are only three novels in this captivating series.  ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" captures the reader's attention almost immediately.  Blomkvist is an extremely relatable character while Salander is an engaging femme fatale in this dark Noir novel.  The reader can easily envision the cold and lonely islands of Sweden as Larsson does an excellent job creating the imagery necessary to tell such a complex yet gripping tale.  Overall, I'd highly recommend ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" I've already started reading ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" as I understand this is a worthy continuation of Blomkvist and Salander's story.",4,1

6575039,Great headset for the price,"Sound quality is good, build quality exceeded expectations. Take notice of the connection, though. It has two separate plugs, one for sound, one for the microphone. So this headset will require an adapter to use on a iPad, iPod or any computer with only one jack for sound/mic. The volume adjuster is nice and works well, microphone is sensitive enough. Overall, I would by this headset again.",5,1

It was a wonderful read, it takes you into the world of BDSM with a Dom and a new Sub and it explores the Subs growing feeling for the world she did not understand and also her growing feeling for the young gorgeous gym owner.  I don't like to give too much of the story away but I would highly recommend it, it is sexy, steamy hot and leaves you wanting more and luckily for us this is the first in hopefully many more.",4,1

2221074,"Good read, but more like a  science textbook","Having been a science major, this book at times reminded me of reading a biology textbook. At other times though, the author does use his literary skills and story telling ability and keeping things humourous; especially when he tells of the murder, deception, treachery, intrigue and chemical warfare of his beloved ants.There is A LOT of theory in this book. He will typically describe an organisms behavior or behavioral trends and then desrcibe the competing hypothoses for these trends, phenomena or divergance from these typical trends.Like I said though, this book is technical. Don't attempt reading it unless you have completed 2 courses of undergrad biology and calculus, as well as chemisty (most of the chemicals used by ants and the like involve simple organic compounds I was a chem major myself.)In other words, this is not like On Human Nature or Journey to the Ants: This is more like a 3rd or 4th year advanced biology course textbook.",4,1
1152673,This book has it all!,"As a reader, this book satisfied me on many levels.  It has a touching romantic reunion, gut-twisting suspense, and wrenching emotional impact.  I especially liked the development of the &quot;villain&quot; because it was done so subtly that even I began to doubt my perception of him.  Ms. Stockenberg excels at novels that explore the mother/daughter relationship and this one is no exception.  If you like suspense, romance, and family relationships all wrapped up in a credible story, TIDEWATER should make you very happy.",5,1
2904322,Amazing,Fantastic novel of interconnected short stories about people trying to survive the apocalypse. Crisp prose and haunting emotion makes this book stand out among most other apocalyptic novels.,5,1

Their banter was hilarious and they seemed like old souls in a young body.I'm not going to delve into the story because I want you to discover the greatness of this book for yourself but,I will warn you. Be prepared to laugh out loud and shed many tears. You are in for a emotional roller coaster ride that you will enjoy immensely.",5,1

5653949,"It's so sad where they are now, buy this and get nostalgic","I'm very surprised the current-day version of this band isn't mainstream. They may as well be with how much they say their name and brag about being in their band...but that's not the case here. The speed of songs like Suicide's An Alternative and Memories Of Tomorrow, the upbeat raw energy of I Saw Your Mommy, the doomy raw energy of I Shot The Devil, all one masterpiece after another. Although probably all fans will disagree with me, I actually think Institutionalized is the worst song on the CD, and especially in its place, since listening to a minute long song does not put me in listening mode for a four minute song. The lyrics also sound pretty forced, but then again, they are not great. But the music keeps me coming back, and you have to own this.",4,1
6519040,Infinitely flexible; a tweaker's delight!,"I purchased the Harmony 520 based on all the favorable reviews I've read, and I must say I'm amazed by this product.  It can control up to 15 ""devices"" and can be programmed for several different ""activities"", such as Watch a Movie, Listen to CD's, etc.  The Harmony website makes configuring your remote a breeze....once you learn to navigate through all the menus, and this does take a little practice.  But once you get the hang of it, there's no end to what you can teach your remote to do for you.  I've never encountered a universal remote that was so flexible and full of options...you can make your commands as straightforward or as complex as you like; the choice is up to you.One slight quibble I have is with the size of the buttons on this particular model.  They are somewhat small (the entire remote is streamlined and sleek), so if you have a big thumb you might run into trouble operating it.  But otherwise it's a great product; I would recommend it to anyone.",4,1
3283170,Awesome Book!,I just want to say that I wanted to see Tina get the crap beat out of her and I don't like abuse. I couldn't stay in the same run for a minute.I did feel sorry for Rever when I seen her had bonded with Tina and then later found his true mate Brenda. I seen the fireworks from the first day they saw each other.Just as with all of these books with this author they just keep sucking me deeper and deeper in. It's like being in a web and not being able to escape. You know the spider is coming but you know that the web won't let you go.The sex and suspense is what draws me in and she is so good with her words and characters. Thank you so much for writing all of these books.,5,1
2005467,Could not put it down...,"I will admit I like hiking and have lived in proximity the northern portions of the AT my whole life.  Having seen periodic articles in our local papers over the years I have had a casual interest in what hiking the AT must be like.  That being said I don't think an interest in hiking is even required to enjoy this well written and engaging book.You'll be drawn in on with the first couple pages as he contemplates the journey and ponders what lies ahead.  As David walks into the woods I felt his pains and concerns and was drawn into the trails quirks and traditions.  I admit I started reading thinking ""heck I'll read a chapter a nite it's a great wind-down book"". WRONG...I was sucked in...three hours and 120 pages later I had to skip to the epilogue so I could satisfy my immediate curiosities and get some sleep...needless to say its and awesome read that I highly recommend.",5,1

Be resigned to a parental arranged match? Oh, Please!The delightful start to this new series deals with this shifter's dilemna, and answers it, ""With magic, of course!"" There is an alternate plane, not too large of course, accessible only by those shapeshifters who are serious about finding a compatible match. Those talented in magic who can access the Crossroads are the gatekeepers.Ezzy feels like her back is against the wall to make a decision to mate, when her friend Kris scandalously suggests using the Crossroads to scope out a potential mate. And, trust me, different shifter types can and do attract to one another. But, the Crossroads is not without its hazards.Damn, I wish I could find my way there!",4,1
464638,Brilliant and Complete,"This is an astounding book. Remember those angels dancing on the head of the pin? Well meet them all and their legions of siblings, both the good and the bad.

This is a great reference book and a fascinating read!",5,1
8325048,Wow I loved these books,"Jack and marissa are so perfect for one another. I loved loved this story. Those two have went through so much in the first book. Now they are forced to deal with the craziness of Los Angeles, Jack's fame, paparazzi, and a cruel evil publicist. I think all the things they had to go through made them so much stronger in the end. I absolutely loved how great of a father Jack was to Tristan. I think that made him that much sexier. When they decided to stop keeping secrets, running away from each other, and not letting the fans tear them apart they finally were able to live their lives. Such a great great story. So highly recommended!",5,1
5723552,One of the Best Albums of the '90s,"""Unplugged"" is Eric Clapton's latter-day masterpiece.  It's intimate and moving with a rich, organic sound.  And, rather than simply rip through his biggest hits on acoustic guitar, E.C. had the good sense to throw in some lesser-known material and experiment with re-interpreting his past work.  ""Signe"" is a beautiful instrumental, ""Alberta"" is a swinging blues that's perfectly suited to the stripped-down treatment, and his jazzy reworking of ""Layla"" stands up well against the landmark original.  This album should always be considered one of Clapton's best.",5,1

The first half was somwhat tedious to me because it focused on - more or less - the ""mechanics"" of being...I felt connection with the spiritual was missing here. But, I stuck with it, and realized the author was laying the foundation for the second half of the book which was about onness, spirituality, and God....The second half of the book was trully awe-inspiring and enlightening. It outlined a truly crediable explination - much based on St. Thomas' teachings - of the nature of spirit, being, good, evil, etc.The only detraction from this book is that it is extreemly detailed and more accessable to a ""student"" of theology rather than the average person (even more so that St. Thomas' works in my view)...But a great book never the less - a real ""keeper""-Joe M.",4,1

But, you will find funny, sweet adventures in all of them with wonderful lessons such as environmentalism and being kind to one another. The illustrations by Almudena Romero are breathtaking as well. This is a triumph of writing you will forever regret missing. You might compare it the Wizard of Oz, but it more than stands apart in its originality.Just don't get hit by the flying muffins.",5,1

They are made of a good quality wood, smoothly sanded, with a lacquered finish and they have a ridged bar that holds folded items.They are of medium size, not as big as the hangers that come with men's suits but they are plenty big enough for my purposes. The metal hanging hook swivels and there are two notches for holding dresses and such in place. I am pleased with them and plan on getting another box of them. They are very well priced.As an additional note, these hangers also are available in a larger pack of 30 hangers at a favorable price. You may not need that many hangers but if you do, it's certainly something to consider.",4,1

The descriptions of the time period was interesting and the great character development allowed you a front row seat into a despicable time in our history.I am not giving it 5 stars because I felt the writing during the Carrier's time in prison did not carry the full impact and weight of the situation and the writing became redundant.

The story is rich, the dialogue excellent. Loved how the author mixed music into the story.  I am very thankful that she did not write these books as &#34;novellas&#34; but chose to put out full tomes.  It reminds me of the story of Christian and Anastasia but without the kink.  Dahlia and River are in love and committed but both have &#34;issues&#34; and secrets that throw road blocks into their being together.  I loved it and would get other books from this author.",5,1

But I guess when you are desparate and in love you do crazy things. Get it, enjoy it then head on over to Torn Between Two Lovers to finish this ride up!!!",5,1
4614869,Looking forward to reading this!,I've already read the first 3 Sorcerer's Ring books and found the story line & characters to be engaging and very interesting.  I can't wait to start in on this one.  I found that this story is not filled with improper word usage and bad spelling like some of the other authors I have read in the past year.  I was so happy to come across this series.,4,1

5138243,Cold.....then hot,"The story started off with me wanting to shake the main female character, but gradually she grew on me.  Jessica was smart and very naive.  Connor was cold yet you could feel his vulnerability through L Chance's writing.  The chemistry between them simmered from the start.Great job with the writing.  Even better you get a finished story and a happy ending.",4,1
7779961,Works Well On Pergo Floors,"TheHoover FloorMate SpinScrub Wet/Dry Vacuum, FH40010Bwas extremely easy to assemble and use.  The upper handle folds downward, so it doesn't take up that much space when stored.This worked well on Pergo laminated floors - ones that have a lot of dog traffic.  The scrubbers cleaned the floor thoroughly and the wet vac did a good job of getting the dirty liquid up off the floor quickly so that it didn't dry and leave a film.  The fact that we weren't reusing the dirty water to wash new sections of the floor is a very nice feature.  The FloorMate didn't seem too heavy or awkward to use, and the controls were nicely designed.It sure beats using a mop and pail, and is much faster too.",4,1

3621753,Good book,"The book was very good, good story, good characters. There's just so much spelling errors and run on sentences, sometimes it was hard to figure out what was being said.  Other then that it was a great read. I would recommend.",5,1
1060480,A Book that actually interested me in Politics,"Wow. I live at a small Army base in Italy, and our book store is some what limited. I saw this book up on the shelves (right next to the O'Reilly Factor) and decided to give it a shot. Within the first three chapters I realized that I must be a Libertarian. All of the points that Mr. Elder makes are clear, concise and well backed with fact. More importantly, for the first time, I heard someone else intelligently discuss issues from the same view point that I discuss them. It's a shame the media only shows Democrat-Republican politics, because this movement is going to grow with a lot of voters, like myself, who are displeased with big government, media hysteria and the self-aggrandizing B.S. of Washington. Heck, I work for the Government and I'll tell you, bigger is definately not better. Open your mind and Mr. Elders book, and you'll feel, like I did, that some one is on the right track, that maybe we'll get the government we deserve.",5,1

1227580,prophetic,"Or, maybe not prophetic, just common sense. Foreword by Sen. Warren Rudman.  This is an analysis of the debt situation in 1992, with plenty of charts.  Blame is laid on both Democrats and Republicans, though it would seem that Clinton did heed these warnings when he became President. Interesting reading for a better understanding of the fact that our ""current"" economic problems are actually over a decade old.",5,1
6779626,Fantastic Apple G4 PB battery?  $30-ish bucks? Great! Would buy again! (and again),"This non-OEM battery looks EXACTLY like Apple's own OEM battery.

Whoever reverse-engineered this battery is an amazing engineer!It works great, provides 4-plus hours of power after being charged (with a non-OEM batter charger / AC power source), and what else can I ask for?BRAVO!",5,1
5731378,Deja Vu All Over Again....,".... as Yogi Berra might have said. It's hard to believe that Tangerine Dream could compose music so absolutely ""spot on"" for the film Sorcerer without having seen the movie but, as pointed out by other reviewers that is exactly what happened. I recommend you see the movie FIRST.  Then, consider buying this CD which is at once captivating but definitely creepy!  Filmed on location in the heart of a Dominican Republic rain forest, Sorcerer is NOT for the faint of heart.  Although the film and the music are both thirty years old, both compare favorably with the music and plot of any contemporary soundtrack or movie plot. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED by a listener who is NOT fond of Tangerine Dream!",5,1
4846094,Distress Through Biology,"This novel takes a candid look at the woman's thought process and the emotional swings associated with suffering through menstruation, while dealing with adversity (such as an antagonistic boss). It also examines the affliction women face in both cultural and spiritual contexts, referring to the fable (or biblical fact, depending on your viewpoint) that women are punished for their misdeed in the Garden of Eden. The plight of dealing with the opposite sex, who is free of suffering, has a profound effect on the protagonist's view. Eve says of men: ""They're all capable of being Hitlers in my view--each and every one of them!"" With thoughts like these rolling around in her head, the reader is inclined to wonder what exactly she might she be capable of doing, and if she will act out on her lethal fantasies. Vividly written, McDowell writes a deft page turner that is heavy on internal characterization and keeps the reader intrigued.",5,1
5172093,Mustang Sally,"After Eli and Alanso made a debacle of things, Sally runs to the Powertools crew for some time away and space to sort out what she really wants, but just as it is all coming together a secret from her past threatens to ruin it all. This was a great finish to Eli and Alanso's story, given that Sally is the elusive finishing third piece to their relationship. You get to know the other five guys (Kaige, Holden, Carver, Roman and Bryce) a bit more in this one too, and I thought that was great, since I didn't feel we got to see much of them in the first book in this series. I look forward to reading the next book in this series, Super Nova, about Kaige, due out December 2013!",5,1

7562499,Electric Wok,I had this wok now for a month and wanted to wait before reviewing to really test it out.  I use it on a daily basis.  It is excellent.  I had no idea how evenly it cooks I know now to do my rice ahead of anything.  Then I stir fry because it takes only 5 min to get the perfect vegetables and chicken.  The shrimp takes a lot less.  Im stil working on sauces.  I use only peanut or sesame oil in it and use only a plastic spatula.  I have no problems with the finish It cleans easily and the base can be easily removed.  I would recommend it.,5,1

2420356,I Have Straight Hair But . . .,"I saw this book in a beauty parlor and couldn't put it down, so I ordered my own copy.  It has tons of tips for any type of hair.  It tells you how to keep your hair in good condition, how to let it be beautiful on it's own without all kinds of glop in it, and much much more.  I haven't finished it yet, but have learned a great deal.  I recommend it to everyone.",4,1

7159597,Works great,"This thing works like a charm. I bought it so that I could use it with a usb otg cable and my phone. It works fantastically for this purpose. I can just leave it in the usb otg and it doesn't even look like there is anything plugged in.Another thing I like about it is there is a led on the back so you can tell that it is being used.My reason for not giving it 5 stars is the ring on the back is not normal sized, I could not fit my keychain through it so I wouldn't lose it. So what I have to do is get some fishing wire or a very small ring to put though there to then fit to the keychain. But other then this 0 problems at all.",4,1

3170774,The American Way,"Steve Darnell and Alex Ross's ""Uncle Sam"" is a devastating read. There's no easy way to summarize the book-- it's most easily described as an all-American fever dream. We follow the titular character as he stumbles through a crime-ridden nation, homeless and decrepit. He is bombarded by memories of the crimes his so-called great nation has committed.There are no two ways about it-- ""Uncle Sam"" is a polarizing read. Its take on American history is unflinching, and the book is quick to contrast the ideals of the United States with its actions. At times Darnell's script seems a little too on-the-nose and simplistic, but his frustration is palpable and gives the book much of its energy. Ross's confident, expressive and very human artwork makes this book a must-read for just about any comics fan.",4,1

2534240,Very Difficult to Get Through,"The back cover of this book makes the hero, an ex-special forces agent named Avakian as one of the most interesting characters since Jason Bourne.  I was greatly disappointed as I found him super boring to say the least.  The book takes place in South Africa and some of the Dutch names are confusing.  The author's writing style is not effective at all (some of the flashbacks are difficult to follow) and I yawned during what should have been tense moments.  Skip this one.",1,0
2055191,READ THIS BOOK!,"I happened to think this was one of the best Seventh Doctor novels that have come out since &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;. Something is affecting the Seventh Doctor, something familiar, and he decides to face it alone and  leave Ace with his old friends Ian and Barbara. But when he arrives in 1963  he comes to realize that everything has changed and neither of his former  travelling companions know anything about ever travelling with a Doctor.  And when The Doctor and Ace reach the source of the problem in Victorian  England it becomes clear to Ace that the Doctor has apparently become evil  and she must flee from him before he kills her. I feel that the Doctor Who  novels work the best when you could picture them as an actual episode.  That's when I start feeling sad. But this book is a must have for fans of  Sylvester McCoy's Doctor and fans of the series. Robert Perry and Mike  Tucker, PLEASE WRITE MORE!",5,1

Truth is funny.  This film is,  in short,  truthfully funny.  Watch and laugh.  Don't assess like you're sitting in Starbucks,  leaning back on lice ridden plush furniture,  drinking a $7 cup of coffee,  while really only holding it to look cool,  tucking your legs under your fat stomach, while watching everyone around you thinking that they are thinking how cool you are.....",4,1

949004,Great Writing & Great Story,"In an ocean of glittering loving agnst filled teenage vampires it was refreshing to read a classic vampire tale. The story is a good one although the specific reason for the main character being a lesbian is still unclear to me...I am not critiquing the fact that she was, I just didn't feel I understood the particular choice. Since the other reviews here will no doubt focus on the likes and dislikes of the story, I want to point out what I found most enjoyable. David Wellington is a great writer. I am not referring to his story line, but rather the way in which he puts the words together. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies - makes no difference - it is just evident that he writes well and that is not something often found in my favorite genre, Horror.",5,1
5431543,It's simply delicious!,"So, to be honest I was a little nervous to see if I could get my family to drink a non-dairy &#34;smoothie&#34;.  I was pleasantly surprised when even my finicky two-year old gulped it down.  I even found him wiping the rim of his glass with his little fingers to get every last drop.  I highly recommend this book!",5,1
7360428,Beating Expectations,"I have been very very pleased with this case, although I wish there was a 4.5 star ratings. Truth to tell, the only quibble I have about this case is that the viewing angle pictured is about the only angle you can get before the magnets let go. But for me, this has been trivial. Otherwise, I have been extremely satisfied with this cover. Light, but provides good coverage for the screen and for the rest of the tablet. It took me a while to become adept at removing the stylus, but it poses no problem now. However, this case provided adequate protection to the table after a 3' fall from a desk to a hardwood floor: nary a scratch nor a hiccup. &#34;It took a lickin' and kept on tickin'&#34;. as they used to stay.I'm very happy with this case so far, and as of now I see no reason to change my opinion.",5,1
2489789,Great Teen Book,"I too have read this book and found it a very good YA read.  I enjoyed how the plot's theme evolved and kept you wondering.It would recommend it readers that like dark fantasy and mystery.  I think if you enjoy authors like Garth Nix, Cassondra Clare, Neil Gaiman, Steven King, EA Poe and Brom or books like Plucker, City of Bones, Riddle of Epsilon, Neverwhere, Graveyard Book than this is right up your alley.  I would also place it in with books like Speak if you are looking for ""teen issues"" themed books.I can't wait for the sequel ""Mr. Monster""  which I will have to get from Amazon UK.",5,1
4547757,Like it - mostly!,"I really like the recipes in this book. I'm always looking for healthy slow cooker books, and this is a pretty good one. I like that the recipes have nutritional information, and that they use fresh, readily available ingredients. On the whole, they're mainstream, family-friendly recipes. I really like the Vegetable Soup, and the Hamburger Pie (with homemade mashed potato topping, yum!) is in my slow cooker as I write this review.The only thing I don't like, and the reason I only gave it 4 stars, are the ridiculous portion sizes. Most recipes have a portion size of 1/2 cup and make 12-14 servings. Come on! It's not a problem doubling the portion sizes, which then makes them normal, but it's the principal of the thing. The recipes are healthy. The authors didn't need to make the portion sizes abnormallly small to make them look healthier.",4,1
1618980,Loved it!!,I loved it!!  There were unexpected twists and turns that kept me guessing. The characters are believable and complex. I kept having to make a mental map in my head about how the characters were connected. I enjoy reading a book where I make guesses about what will happen next--and be completely wrong. This was one of those books. A mystery without blood and gore. Fantastic!!,5,1
5957669,I'VE BEEN THUNDERSTUCKED!!!!!,"This is an AWESOME cd. AC/DC really knows how to please their fans and this LIVE cd is no exception. The song collection was great and they were very good choices. Brian Johnson did a great job with the vocals and Angus was just pheonomenal as always on lead guitar. If your an AC/DC fan then you're nuts if you don't already have this cd, and thats the truth. Other rock fans should get this as well. OUT OF THIS WORLD!I highly recommend on getting this cd.",5,1

532394,This book should make us all pause,"This is a great, necessary AND daunting book.  Not daunting in how it is written-- Gazzaniga is a clear writer-- but it what it suggests, namely that as right as you think you are is as wrong as you can turn out to be.  As much as we humans like to think we aren't governed by reflex, but by reflection this books demonstrates that the circuitry in our brains can be ""hard-wired"" in such a way as to set up reflexes in our mind and make true objectivity very difficult.  Maybe the lesson to take from it is to assume that we all shoot from the hip much of the time and need to pause more and gather as much facts and data as we can before we come to a conclusion.  Very thought provoking. I would recommend this book highly.",5,1

3202741,Review from Books That Heal Kids,I am an elementary school counselor and I teach lessons around the message that it's okay to make a mistake and we all make them. Most importantly - how to recover from a mistake! Kids are working hard everyday practicing and acquiring new skills in so many areas. Part of growing up is learning how to deal with making a mistake. This is a brand new book to my shelf so I haven't gotten a chance to use it yet. It's going to be a HIT. No doubt about it because of the empowering message. Kids need to hear it's absolutely OKAY to flub up because as we say in our school: Mistakes are opportunities for learning. Mistake DOES NOT mean failure or there is something wrong with you. Sometimes children get that stuck in their heads. You're going to appreciate this new one. It's well written with great illustrations.,5,1

1712042,Don't let the cover put you off,"I've looked at this book before and didn't buy it b/c of the horrible cover.  This is an outstanding book!  This book is better than three of the four Malcolm Gladwell books I've read.  This is the first book I have ever read then liked so much and felt it was important enough that I immediately started reading it again to really burn it in.  It touches on personal habits, business habits, so on and so on, it really covers everything, it is far more in-depth than I expected.  The best book I have read in years!",5,1
8493247,This series is so crazy and amazing at the same time,"OMG What craziness. This series is so crazy and amazing at the same time. One of my fears comes true and someone has been following Juliette every time she meets Elliott. Spending most of her life with these people, being the president's mistress and sons of the president disappearing she should have known &#34;eyes&#34; would be on her. She is just lucky it was not someone ruthless.With two brothers down, suspicion arising and what looks like only one book to go I was curious what this book would entail. We gain more insight into the gang, the past of Elliott and Juliette as well as Jase. We get history, thoughts of the present and desires of the future. The author is slowly pulling everything together and you are left with a semi-cliffhanger as you will wonder who and how it will conclude. The craziness of it all is exciting and I am counting the days until the next book in the series releases.",5,1

2014969,A Brief History of Physics,"I just discovered this book in my school library yesterday.  It is quite fortunate that I did!  Reading the original A Brief History of Time left me with a few questions, and this illustrated version answered nearly all of them.  It is very easy to read and understand (thanks to Hawking's lighter tone of writing).  As he states in the preface, simply reviewing the illustrations and captions you can get the main idea of the Future Light Cone, the Singularity theorem, general relativity, abolition of absolute time, travelling through space-time with the aid of wormholes, and much more.  Not only do you get a quick lesson on cosmology and space-time, but you also learn of the famous physicists throughout time.  This book may also serve as a great vocabulary builder.  It is my opinion that A Brief History of Time should be a required read in high school science classes.",5,1

Each of these episodes could have stood alone as a feature movie.Walker was far more talented than he was ever given credit.  He could say more with a raised eyebrow or a cold stare than many actors can with pages of dialogue.  And he could be funny too!Begining with the first episode, it is interesting to see the character of Cheyenne develop and learn more about him.

I found the life of Sojourner Truth to be both challenging and inspiring. Early in her life she began constructing her views and putting her beliefs into practice. She found strength to forgive her owners without ever excusing what was done to herself or others. A truly impressive accomplishment. The author managed to give evidence of extensive research without being in the least tedious. He presented the life of a multifaceted person while including the things that revealed her limitations and humanity. It is one of the best written biographies that I have read. I highly recommend it to anyone. It blessed me.,5,1

This 3 1/2 hour DVD is a must for any collection of women's stories!  Sure to inspire the viewer to her own greatness!",5,1
4938745,"Great ending, worth reading them all to get here","The writers skills continued to improve through the progression of the 5 levels/stories.  By book 5 it is hard to believe the work is being given away for free.  Definitely on my look for and pay for more list.  While I strongly recommend reading them all in order, if your feeling cheap or in a hurry, you could probably get by with reading book 1 and 5. But again, read them all, it's worth it.  In the 5 books there was only one place that I noticed an author cheat to extend the plot, it was in the last 3rd of book 5 (horn delay).  My perception of the character and the situation made the delay seem unlikely, but distantly possible.  In the end, I thought the author made a good choice.The key to these books is the realism, the characters are real people, solving real problems, with real people skills and problems.",5,1
4181860,"The Slog of Slogs, Boys!","I liked this book.  It was grim.  It was violent.  It was peppered with gnostic imagery and philosophical meandering.  Those are things I enjoy, and things I expect from Bakker.What I've also grown to expect is slow progression.  I really could have used more plot and less grueling descriptions of battles in which people we care nothing about are slaughtered wholesale.  When the plot pops, it pops, but too often Bakker buries it under layers of fantastical war fiction.  Similar in spirit to the second entry in his previous trilogy, but less focused.",4,1
4061816,Praying In Color,"I was &#34;stuck and bored&#34; with praying, yet deep down I knew that my spirit yearned to go to God.  When I draw / doodle in prayer, I discover that while my hands, and eyes are occupied,  my spirit thoughts are free to yield to Him.  Sybil MacBeth confronts all those excuses, fears, and objections we have to drawing, then, - with grace and without  judgement - she lovingly encourages and gives you permission to step into this unfamiliar path anyway.  The book itself is colorful and delightfully planned.  Plus, I had a blast shopping for a new set of pencils and markers.",5,1

Bruce would much rather be replacing the soon-to-retire anchorman. Essentially, Bruce is disconnected with everything in his life and rarely misses an opportunity to complain about it. This movie is rambunctiously funny. Jim Carrey is the man. I can't help but recommend it.",5,1
2907395,A passionate plea for community,"When our true selves and the lives we are actually living are at odds, it takes a toll on our being. Yet, it often requires a personal crisis to recognize that we are out of synch with our values and beliefs. ""Disregarded"" is a morality tale about the importance of authenticity in our work lives and our personal lives. Mr. Bender speaks eloquently for all of us yearning to exercise our unique gifts. This should be required reading for anyone toiling in the educational system today. His story is rich with insight gleaned from an extensive bibliography and Bender has extracted the kernel of truth from a variety of philosophies, including leadership theory, social science, spirituality and literature. An engaging reevaluation of what it means to be disregarded and how we can rise above situations to reclaim our dignity and forge a work of value.",5,1

The new technology in the LED screen makes editing photos much easier as the view angle is no longer critical as on my older iMac. But enough about the computer. When I went to load my Adobe Creative Suite (a collection of 6 or 8 discs) I found this iMac does NOT have a CD/DVD built in drive, as does my older one. Well, I called Apple and their solution was their super duper, very expensive latest model disk drive that I could have rushed delivered for free. All I had to do is pay the big buck and wait for 2 weeks. OUCH!I wanted faster a free deliver with a more reasonable price. That's where my ol' buddy Amazon came thru for me. This one was very inexpensive and with Prime, I had it in 24 hours for only a couple extra bucks for overnite shipping.

They are just out of high school and each one enters into a powerful complicated romantic relationship during the Mystic summer. The movie is intimate in a most beautiful way. It is a strong 5 stars. 1988 must have been a fantastic movie year as it is also the year of ""Rain Man.""Julia Roberts, Annabeth Gish and Lili Taylor star in this film.  Mystic CT stars, too, as this most beautiful part of the State in the summer is shown in all of its summer glory. Mystic Pizza is a real restaurant where the girls worked in the summer.",5,1
9020916,What was cut...?,"I was kind of surprised by this film in the sense that this doesn't fit into Hollywood's formula for making horror movies these days. Meaning that the system thinks that most horror fans have double digit IQ's. Then I found out that it was independently made, and it all made sense. It actually has a carefully orchestrated plot. It even builds up on a mental level and not just on a visual one. Of course, they're really are a lot of brain-dead horror fans out there who couldn't understand something as clever as this if the jigsaw killer made their life depend upon it. As far as the uncut version goes, I wouldn't waste your money on it unless you don't have a copy of it already in your collection. I don't know what insignificant detail that the MPAA made them cut out of this movie, because I didn't see it at all.

Which one you get should be based on the number of adults &amp; kids in your viewing party. If there are more adults, rent it or get it, if you have more kids, go to the theater. Its not really that bad.But why? Simply because this, the original, has more profound humor that kids won't get.

5538579,Killer collection,"What a great deal.  Lots of intriguing new thriller material here I haven't yet read.  But I've read and reviewed Toni Dwiggins' Quicksilver, and she appears to be in good company in this collection.  I'll be off to explore more of this group, but for now here's my take on Quicksilver:It's a treat to stumble across a thrilling story, well-told. But it's much better to find one that also manages to teach a little something along the way.Toni Dwiggins has written a terrific story that will make your brain that much better for having read it. The beauty of Quicksilver is that it informs effortlessly. A completely painless injection of knowledge, if you will. Bill Bryson and Jon Krakauer do this best, but Toni Dwiggins seems to have taken notes.This story illuminates an aspect of the California Gold Rush that I had no idea existed. And now, I'm fascinated to learn more.Fantastic.",5,1

Pulls ups are the foundation of the fighting man and a fit man. If you can't do puil-ups, there is no shame in that. However, the same is not in seeking improvement. It takes time, and even in the world of the quick solution, even this one tells you to get their in 7 weeks, you need to put in work.I have used it, and I remember when I used to struggle to do six, now I can do twelve straight and still knock out more.

633828,Starts out a bit confusing but ends up good,"The reason I say the beginning was confusing is because I had to learn the language of the time period the book was set in--the future.  After reading &#34;For Darkness Shows the Stars&#34; I thought I'd be somewhat familiar with terms used, but this story takes place in a separate development, therefore the characters came up with some of their own terms in connection with the victims of the past tragedy and the explanation of the shared history of both peoples.  After a few chapters wherein I learned a bunch of terms that applied to new inventions, the book became easier to read.  I would suggest sticking with it until you become a bit more comfortable with terms like palmports, genetemps, flutternotes, regs, reduced, etc.It's a good sci-fi dystopian story but along the lines of &#34;The Scarlet Pimpernel.&#34;",4,1

2610139,Poorly disguised propaganda,"I forced myself through this to the end because I can't stand to not finish a book. But I should have stopped and not wasted my time. I'm assuming this was the author's first attempt at writing. Poor character development, trite plot, lame action. It feels like someone wanted to write a sunday school story but tried make it interesting to draw in preteen kids so threw in some ""medieval-like"" action and setting. Every other page is some repetitive speech on God's love. Or someone says ""help me Jesus"" and is immediately cured of some sort of opium addiction with no withdrawals or work on their part. A woman in a crowd throwing things at a suspected criminal overhears him mumble something about God or Jesus and immediately stops the abuse because she now wonders ""Is he a murderer....or a Christian man?"" Because of course the two things are mutually exclusive. I even got the book free on kindle and was mad that I wasted time on it.",1,0

He keeps up a series of disguises and meets with FBI agents and reporters and gangsters. There are some great characters in the book. My favorite was a Bosnian gangster named Little Boy. It's all a little over the top, but not completely unbelievable. There were times when I wasn't sure which way the story was going to go.Chris Knopf writes a tight thriller that kept me turning pages and wondering what was going to happen next. I've always like a good heist or con man story, and while this isn't either, it had the same feeling of a protagonist that manages to stay one step ahead of the game. It was a lot of fun to read.",4,1

The editing of the concert is a bit jarring sometimes. You can't seem to focus on any one image for more than a second or two. But that is a small gripe as the music speaks for itself. Also, the extras are extremely satisfying, all the music videos from Afterglow and a 10 minute featurette with Sarah and Rex.",5,1

6161339,No Wonderland,"This is a well-produced, pristine recording of one of the worst new scores for a Broadway show in memory.  The cast is full of top-notch actor/singers, and one cringes at the thought that this is the type of material they've trained for all these years.  Not only is the music derivative and boring, but it covers so many styles and genres that there is no cohesion or through-line to the theme of the show (if there is one).  Add to that the clunky, obvious lyrics that lay like obstructions over the music and you have a score that never should have seen the light of a recording studio.  Frank Wildhorn has produced one floppo musical after another in the past decade and ""Wonderland"" continues the tradition.  Just skip on down the yellow brick road.",1,0

8073251,"Tedious, repetitive and derivative","I will admit from the outset, I was unable to get past the 6th chapter. It's highly unusual for me to DNF a book but this one stretched my credulity to the breaking point. The writing was ... not polished, and it needed a really strong edit to weed out the insanely repetitive phrasing and to create something other than cardboard characters and situations. I hopscotched to various points in later chapters hoping that the author had found some rhythm but unfortunately not. Other readers might not mind the roughness and the derivative treatment. But for me, this was not worth the effort.",1,0

BUT the story and the characters have me in their grubby paws and don't seem to be letting go.And I find myself twirling my hair and batting my eyelashes dreaming about my own hot biker dude.If you enjoyed Undeniable and the 'Man' series, you obviously MUST get this.",5,1

I found Roxann and Joe completely likeable and respectable.  Unfortunately, there is such a little part in this book for Joe and she is so good at blocking the few advances he makes that when she and Joe fall in love, you find yourself asking, ""Where was I?""  But buy the book, anyway.  Stephanie Bond moves the story forward at a good clip and with firm control, keeping you reading and wondering and feeling fairly satisfied that all the pieces of her complex puzzle fit so nicely together.  All but the romance.",4,1

I'm giving this 4 stars although I likely think it would end up just under that rating if they allowed partial stars. Overall the stories were an okay mix. ""The Last Nephew"" was a real standout story for me. Reading this issue was enough to convince me that I need to keep reading subsequent issues, so I've added all of them to my TBR list. I suggest you do the same.",4,1
5267654,Sweet Sensual Rapunzel,"Wow! I saw an email earlier today about this ebook and I immediately downloaded it and read it tonight. I mean, I just finished it. I adored her book PASSION and especially loved PATIENCE. Her stories are about living life to the fullest. Although her books are sensual, they are also centered around FAMILY, FOOD, FRIENDS, FAITH and FIDELITY also. This book was novella length, and did NOT disappoint. I really fell in love with the honesty of the characters and the classic Rapunzel story retold. I've been looking forward to her next book PRIMROSE and I don't care WHEN she finishes it, I like Matthew (from PATIENCE) will wait for her to finish PRIMROSE in her own good time. She is my all time favorite romance novelist and I trust that she won't put a book into the world until it is JUST RIGHT. What a lovely surprise to get this unexpected ebook.",5,1

She hopes that her interpretation of events and her study of Philippians is leading her in the right direction.  She is also at a crossroads in her love life.  Will she choose Dan, the Seattle lawyer, who makes her heart skip a beat when he enters a room?

796957,A Good Story Teller,"&quot;I wish I could write non-fiction like that,&quot; is what ran though my mind after opening the book and finding it hard to put down. Having just returned from London I found the tales and yarns behind the writing and distribution of the English Bible not only factually true but exciting to read.All early translators from Jerome to Wycliffe to Tyndale and Luther found those in control of the masses resistant to free speech, open books and the truth of scripture. Just a few anecdotes about the ways the monarchs of government and church treated their slaves/serfs shows us why they hated scripture for it led inexoribly to free thinking and free living. In the same ways that slave owners in America, Nazis, Communists and South African leaders hated scripture the brutal popes and kings burned those at the stake who dared publish it for all to read.This book can inspire us all to speak boldly about freedom of speech and freedom of thought.",5,1

6003902,Chill Is A Thrill,"Jimmy Buffett started out as a country singer-songwriter.  His first several releases were strong country-rock records.  In 2003, Mr. Buffett dueted with Alan Jackson on countrified &quot;It's Five O'Clock Somewhere&quot; and the results were Mr. Buffett's first number one record as the song topped the Country charts.  For Licensed To Chill, Mr. Buffett again duets with Mr. Jackson as well as several other notable country stars like Kenny Chesney, George Strait, Toby Keith and Martina McBride.  The results are a pleasant mixing of country and parrothead rock.  The album's best track is his lone duet with a non-country performer, Bill Withers, &quot;Playin' The Loser Again&quot; which finds Mr. Buffett holding his own with the powerful Mr. withers and sounding quite soulful.  Licensed To Chill is yet another solid album that will keep Parrotheads happy until Mr. Buffett's next release.",4,1

(I don't like the one of a child looking into a mirror while holding a candle in a dark room. It looks a little too scary for a child's book). But other than that the pictures are beautiful. Children from all different cultures/nationalities are represented. The short commentary by Rick Warren in the back is a nice touch. He explains each line of the prayer in simple terms. This is a nice addition to any child's library.,5,1

I absolutely loved this book and it is classic Robyn Carr writing.  Great Characters, we originally met Laine in a previous book.  A great setting, back in the seaside town of Thunder Point.  Her writing about Thunder Point almost makes the town a secondary character.  It sounds like a wonderful place!!  I love the secondary romances often featured in Robyn Carr's books.  It is these stories which make putting her books down impossible!  Don't make the mistake I made last night....I started this book at 8pm and was up to 3am reading!

With abundant footnotes, this book allows any of us to print documents, hammer on the halls of power, and the media, and demand the impeachment of a regime that has engineered a huge crime against Americans, humanity, in their bid for global dominance.Ruppert makes a compelling case which cannot be ignored, and deserves to be plastered across the world's headlines.  Our greatest hope for our country and the world is to rein in this regime (and, yes- it must be said- this crosses party lines- this is a bipartisan crime revealing the darkest side of the Shadow Government) which uses war and terror to silence dissent and control an increasingly aware public.The book is a powerful tool for all who seek truth, peace, justice, hope, in challenging the corrupt forces that dominate the world's most powerful institutions whose reign is about to end.",5,1

Its a keeper all the way through, except for the inexplicable inclusion of ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" a song from her last album released just one year ago. ""Sorry for Love"" is from the last album too, but at least its a newly produced version. ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" is a good song, but doesn't belong on this album; not only because of it's previous release, but also because it's sound doesn't mesh with the other songs which are all very contemporary dirty pop. But aside from this, its a step in the right direction from everyone's favorite chest thumping Canadian diva.",4,1

You do have to wedge it in there and I wouldnt want to do it more than once or twice.The buttons are all accessible to me, but might be tough to get to for my 3 year old. Also the home button is a little tough to click on. But my son doesnt seem to mind.I would recommend this case for anyone under the age of 6.I give it 5 stars for my 3 year old.",5,1

I've been a Drama High fan since my sophomore year in and high school. And now im a 20 year old sophomore in college still reading about Jayd and her crew.

514215,A WELL READ ROGUISH ROMANCE,"British actress Serena Gordon becomes the voice of Victoria, she's perfect.  Gordon is appropriately regal and reads this romance for teens and tweens with relish.Lady Victoria Arbutnot is a wealthy sixteen year old who knows her own mind, and thinks she knows everyone else's, too.  She's a privileged miss having grown up in India where she's been pampered and given her own way.  That comes to an abrupt halt when she's sent off to London to find a husband.Victoria doesn't waste a minute as she's barely aboard ship before she sets her eyes on and her cap for good looking Hugo Rothschild (he's the rogue of the title, although she doesn't know that yet).  He doesn't put up too much of a battle and their romance is off to a fine start.Ooops -  there's unexpected interference from the captain of the ship, Jacob Carstairs.  He's also young and handsome, and a self-appointed guardian of Victoria's heart and future.Listen to find just what that future may hold.- Gail Cooke",4,1
9398710,So boring,This movie was boring at best. So completely disappointed. I am just happy we did not go to the theater and pay thirty bucks to see it. I got half way though the movie and gave up. My husband finished watching it but said it was painful to do.,1,0
1496434,Haunting and beautiful,"This book is achingly honest, and so beautifully written, it reads like poetry.  If you look at Sting's vast lyric's catalog, this is not surprising, yet it is still a lovely revelation of his talent seen from a new perspective.It is vulnerable, without sinking into the realms of pity.  Startling sometimes, yet without artifice.  Baldly truthful without being arrogant or self-serving.  And in the end, it is so very readable.",5,1

While I love to bake, I also am a full time mom who works a full time job at a day care and a part time job as a cashier. If you are someone who bakes everything from scratch this book is not for you. However, for those of us who do not have that luxury, this little tidbit could really come in handy. There are a lot of really yummy ideas in the book that are easy to actually make. I also liked the ideas for the gift jars. For those of us on a tight budget,little gifts like that are very beneficial. I will definitely keep an eye out for more books from these ladies!",5,1

2583045,Well-written bio and advice book.,"""Raising the Bar"" is a great read! It's a fascinating bio about Gary Erickson and the journey he took in creating Clif Bar. I bought this book because I'm thinking about starting a business in convenience/health food sector. I found his adventures and thoughts to be very interesting. He also talks about independently-owned businesses and shares his views and opinions on them.However, don't expect any concrete business development tips or lessons. This book is just about Erickson's life experiences and the lessons he learned along the way. Nevertheless, I found ""Raising the Bar"" to be an inspiring and worthwhile read for any young entrepreneur!",5,1

4057562,Hothouse,"I approached this book with much anticipation, and for much of it, was gratified.  The mood and setting are remarkably delineated.  Set in a remote ""hospital"" for women in a bleak 1920's Finland, Chapman fills the pages with sensuous detail clearly bringing to life the humid, hothouse atmosphere.  It is unclear why many of these women continue to take up bedspace in what purports to be a hospital, which includes a floor more like a private club for women who are bored, hysterical, or just plain trying to get away from their real lives.  Such indulgence is tolerated so long as their providers have the funds to keep them there, and their society is comforting for them, with the familiar faces, food, time in the sauna and games playing in the evenings.  The book is partially narrated in a first person collective, which gives an unsettling tone throughout, alerting the reader to plot developments, so that when there is a sudden shift, it is not entirely unexpected.",4,1

8766014,Christie At Her Most Entertaining,"Bravo to the makers of this film, who faithfully adapted Agatha Christie's story to the screen, keeping the plot and characters true to the novel.  Joan Hickson is the quintessential Miss Marple and finds herself with an excellent supporting cast that enhances this classic whodunit.  A generous helping of romance and two deadly murders make this a most entertaining way to spend two hours. Mystery lovers will be challenged with the unexpected twists and red herrings that made the book so popular.  Was it the overzealous sister?  the genteel antiques collector?  the timid spinster?  the glamorous governess? the unhappy stepdaughter who evolves into Cinderella?  All is revealed on location in a picturesque English village.  Sit back and enjoy!",5,1
8822462,Mind-bending fun,"This is one of the coolest, most bizarrely funny movies I have ever seen. It stayed with me long after I left the movie theater, and I just wanted to view it again and again.  Charlie Kaufman wrote a brilliant screenplay and all the actors do a wonderful job as characters who develop such an anguish over their own existence.  I love that it is a totally original tale.  I recently added this DVD to my collection because it is one of my favorite movies of all time!",5,1

8733720,Puts nannies in a bad light,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...I find the thriller The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992) a great movie.  I saw it in the theater back in 1992 and was surprised by how good it was.  It stars Rebecca DeMornay, Annabella Sciorra, Matt McCoy, Ernie Hudson, Madeline Zima, and Julianne Moore.  When I think of Rebecca DeMornay, I think her playing the role of Mrs. Mott in this movie.  She did a fantastic job as the nut case nanny.My favorite character in the movie is the aggressive, busy body Marlene, played by Julianne Moore.  My favorite line of the movie is when Marlene says, ""Figure it out.  You've got a Harvard education"".  Some of the scenes are flat out unbelievable and laugh-out-loud funny, such as when Claire and Michael take back the bike they gave to Solomon (played by Ernie Hudson) as a gift.Overall, this is a great thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend it.",5,1
9275338,Better than Frozen,"I just watched the movie 'Frozen' last night and wrote a review saying it did not deserve even the one star I was forced to give it.  Buried I'd say is worth the one star, but only because of Ryan Renolds acting, although renting it on Blu-Ray thinking it might be of better quality I have to say it isn't worth the extra cost.  The movie has no point whatever unless it was trying to convince Americans not to go to countries like Irag or Afganistan in civilian jobs to make presumably a lot of money.  In the end the company Renold's character works for sells him out so as not to have to pay the insurance when he turns up dead. Add to the lack of substance, a margin of gore to the Nth degree and you have yourself a one star movie.",1,0

The Heralds and especially Lavan's Companion help him learn who he is.Lavan, being the very first major Firestarter has no one who is experienced with Firestarting to teach him how to control his gift.

Unfortunately, I kept stumbling over the baby-talk, and trying to read it was impossible. I would get hung up on a paragraph just trying to figure out what the child (not baby) was trying to say. In some cases what was written didn't even resemble a real word. I hope the message of the book goes far and wide, but I also hope at some time the book is revised for more readable content.",2,0

4199994,Enchantment is not just for fairy tales,Many books receive all sorts of great hype only to leave the reader disappointed from some rehashed information; this is not one of those books. Guy has done a fantastic job in laying out a book that can actually help the reader. You will find a path that explains how to become more passionate about what you do as well as how to really help people around you.There are plenty of examples of how to be more persuasive in both theory but also in the ability to really communicate with others on a higher level. There are also short stories at the end of each chapter that underscore what the chapter was about. The formulas used for success are also easy to follow but even better they would be easy to implement.There is some thinking involved on your part as a reader but that is one of the many reasons that this is an exceptional read.,5,1

Mr. Strand was certainly at his best. I honestly kept wondering how a man can sit (or stand), write such humorous dialogue and situations, and keep the story fresh, interesting, and moving along with a good rate of speed.This book had few to zero editing problems. I found no grammar errors, misspelled words, or crazy mixed up subjective/objective useage.  While not an all out horror, there were many horrific scenes.Highly recommend",5,1

Two damaged people helping to free one another and finally finding a way to love each other freely. Archer, a man without a speaking voice, but with a voice so loud it was impossible not to hear him, not to love him. Bree, the one person who could actually see him, who wanted to see him, helping him to unlock that place inside of him that, even though he didn't know it, was aching to come out.I love the beauty in the simplicity, the smallest things in life can make the longest lasting impression. This book has an overabundance of beauty and it has certainly made an impression on me. One I will not soon forget.",5,1

The identity of one of the crooks may surprise you.This is another in the new series of animated Scooby-Doo movies that are far superior to the old cartoons. The stories are better, the mysteries more involved and there's more interaction amongst Mystery, Inc. members.If you like Scooby-Doo, then don't pass this up. It appeals to adult fans and kids alike.",5,1

The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!",4,1

8590731,A long boring mess of a film,"They said Dune couldn't be filmed, well they tried and failed. This is an absolute mess of a boring long winded film. The plot of this film involves two warring space dynasty's fighting for over magical spice, which is an obvious reference to people warring over oil.... And guess what? It happens in a desert, it's so obvious. This film is such a muddled mess of Dune it's just sad. It's been years since i read the original book, so i don't remember if a large amount of what happens in this film happens in the book.It's a horrid disaster, and it totally bombed at the box office. Maybe it's due to David Lynch trying to inject the David Lynch feel into the feel, maybe that's why we get things like Heart Plugs. I mean were those in the books? What a pretentious mess of a film.",1,0

Circumstances dash their dreams - and can love penetrate the prisons they've built around themselves?This movie, despite its age, evades ""Dated"" and can be thoroughly enjoyed by younger, modern audiences. There's a bit of us in the former country girl with dreams of making enough money for a real home with her brother, and for a couple of hours our dreams can come true with Holly's. Highly recommend.",5,1
4203305,Tah (one of the three stories in this volume),"All three stories were very good. Tah is not covered much in other reviews. It is worthy of note.Tah is a young chinese boy who is regrettably a soldier. He dreams of spinning tops and kites and things a young boy is supposed to be amused with rather than war. Quite a poignant story offering very personally the futility and waste of life in war. Especially, when it is not participated in really by one's own choice or purpose.The story Tah was L Ron Hubbard's first published story, and I suspect is more true to his own feelings of war as he mentioned in later writing's he admitted he knew some things when he was a young man....Wonderfully enacted and dramatized in the Audiobook!!",5,1

At the beginning of the book you'll find a Bible verse as part of the book's introduction. Throughout the book you will find snippets such as this lending a poetic feel to the book. What I loved most was how Mathis carefully crafted the characters as each character steps forward to move the story along. This is the first Oprah's Book Club 2.0 selection I've read and I look forward to reading more. Hopefully, future the Oprah book selections will be as elegantly written as this one.",4,1

9288630,My First Faust,"Never saw Faust before but got this since I always trust the work of Alagna & Gheourgiu.  It was wonderful & I really enjoyed the staging & the singing but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that you could find some of the scenes a bit offensive if you are more conservative in your viewing.  There's a scene where women lick blood off of a ""bleeding"" crucifix - I get that it was representing the devil's doing but some may find it a bit much.  What I had trouble with was the scene where they had the talents of their incredible ballet company completely wasted by having the lot of them rolling around on the ground having pretty graphic simulated sex.  I just thought it went further than it had to & I wanted to see the dancers DANCE, not roll around on the ground.  So for that I give it 4 stars but if something like that wouldn't bother you than it is definitely a 5 star production.",4,1

8721636,Disappointing Blu-Ray Quality,"I have both the DVD and just this week received the Blu-Ray version. The HD quality is lacking. Most notably in the hanger deck scenes near the end where it shows Laskey walking to the helicopter when Senator Chapman and Ms. Scott are being taken to Pearl Harbor and again when the bombs are being loaded (same camera angle). In addition, the interior shots during the ship's medical department scenes show a poor quality. The center of the screen is HD but the outer edges (a good portion not just a tiny section) is totally out of focus for the entire scenes of the Japanese prisoner taking a hostage and killing crew members. It is very apparent the scene was either poorly shot or the HD conversion was not completed.The movie itself is fantastic!  Blu-Ray quality, in my opinion, should be much better than this giving you are paying more.It is watchable exterior shots are great!  But...",2,0

3825874,WOOSAH!!!!,"I really don't know where to start with this review. When I found out what this book was about, I really did not want to read it. At the insistence of some friends and the author, I continued to read. During this read, I went thru several emotions from being upset, angry and just plain mad. Author Boo Jackson wrote this book in such a believable fashion, that I had to look at some of her pictures just to make sure that she was African American. She wrote this book from the eyes of a Klansman and wrote it as if she was in that body. I recommend that you read this book and let your children and grandchildren read this book. There is so much history in this book and this story needs to be told. It is not for the faint. Enlighten your kids and let them know what people had to endure so that they will know the struggle. Great Job Boo!!!!! I am a FAN for life now.",5,1
2653344,Fun Look Back,"Seth Davis's WHEN MARCH WENT MAD is a very fun book to read. The first two-thirds of the book is classic. In fact, if Davis could have found an ending I would rank it with A SEASON ON THE BRINK as college basketball's greatest inside look. But, the book's ending is much like the 1979 championship game itself, somewhat anti-climatic. Still, Davis writes exceptionally well and the pages turn quickly.Apart from the book itself, my only real complaint is that when I received it in the mail from Amazon.com the binding of the book was cracked with the first few pages ready to fall out. Thereafter the book wouldn't close properly until I ripped the offending pages out. Not what you expect when you purchase a book new.",4,1

My daughter loves the book, and answers 'where's my sleepy baby?' each time by seeming to hug herself and say her version of 'me'.  The last couple of pages aren't as interesting as the rest [to me - my daughter's fine with them], but my daughter loves the book, and the repetition and wording are perfect for bedtime.

It's fiction so don't get it twisted. I like to read about prosperous strong Black men and like to fantasize about the way Rochelle's men treat Black women. They are always financially secure and have lasting/bonding friendships with other Black men of the same caliber. The world is so full of crime and negativity that I read Ms. Aler's books to escape. If you are looking for escapism and romance, then I would highly recommend this series.",4,1
3070663,Excellent Young Adult Book!,"I like to read some of my oldest child's books, and I must say that this is one of the better ones. &#34;The Legend of the Blue Eyes&#34; was a different type of vampire style book. I loved the way the author described all of the different creatures in this story with so much detail, as there were much more than just vampires. The main character, Arianna Grace is a strong and powerful young female that will be a great role model for the young girls who read this trilogy. I highly recommend this exciting book.",5,1

I particularly enjoy the way he describes something. His word choices bring to life the setting, the action, and the emotions of his characters.

However, the last cut on this CD seems to answer me when I say I want more, and it is like House speaking to me musically... You Can't Always Get What You Want, performed by Hugh Lurie's band, Band from TVThe  soundtrack is not a hit driven musical pieces. These 12 cuts fit the House tome. The music is somber and bittersweet, just like the show.

While I was left wanting more of Daphne and Hartwell, their relationship and development of their feelings is believable for the short length.The love of a good woman is exactly what Hartwell needs to overcome stuttering and step out into the ton. Daphne is the perfect match for him. Her personality is just right to draw out the side of Hartwell he didn't even know existed.Hartwell isn't an alpha male. However, his weaknesses and lack of socializing added to his character. An alpha male wouldn't have worked as Daphne's hero. Since she is a widow, she more daring and outspoken for this era.I recommend this book to any reader looking for a quick historical romance that sizzles.4 Stars - A Great ReadNote: I requested this book from Net Galley.",4,1
9074651,MacGyver-Complete 6th Season,"I'm a big MacGyver and Stargate fan, also a big fan of Richard Dean Anderson. I highly recommend this box set of dvds. I love all the MacGyver episodes when they first aired. They were great, and was glad they put them out on dvd. I only wish they could have had some ""special features"" like behind the scenes, some out takes, etc, commentaries, etc. That would have been great! But since they didn't put anything on those I still enjoy watching the episodes. Looking forward to getting season 7 when it comes out in October and the Two MacGyver movies as well. :-)All the best.

Now I'm on my 2nd one of these.  Good thing they're reasonably priced I guess.  This is very nearly identical to the OEM part, but the rubber on these I think is just a tiny bit less generous.  That's why I knocked it down a point.  The difference is very little and you have to try to notice, but in full disclosure it is not as nice as the OEM.  Then again, it doesn't hinder you looking through the viewfinder in any way so why get too worried...",4,1

There are some negative reviews here... and that's okay... everyone has a right to their own opinion. I, personally, enjoyed this book. This is the first series of Brooks that I read where the character development is superb and there is a heavy dose of reality mixed in with the fantasy (dealing with issues of death, intimacy, etc.)...  I don't like reviews that give away the story. That's why you read the book... so, with that said, I think this book is worth the read if you are a fan of fantasy without being overzealous. Afterall, it's fantasy.",5,1
6508026,"Fast, Reliable, Better Than Linksys",Used the SB5120 to replace Linksys BEFCMU10 (Version 3.0).  The SB5120 performs better and is much more stable.I had performance and reliability problems using VOIP service over my Linksys cable modem.  Under load the Linksys cable modem has high latency and performs poorly.  The Linksys cable modem required a reset a few times a week. (Note: no problems with my Linksys VOIP router.)With the SB5120 my VOIP connection sounds better and is more stable (no cable modem resets required).  My overall latency is lower and WEB pages load much faster.Packet forwarding performance is much better with the SB5120.,5,1

Huh?I couldn't keep the characters straight, I ended up taking notes.  That being said.... the characters were hateful.  Nothing redeeming whatsoever.  E very page (just about) kept asking.... are you okay?It was odd how close they got to the zombies.... even bringing one into their refuge without knowing if they were contagious.Lastly, it always amazes me that during TEOTAWKI nobody really cares about their lost ones (except one guy).

2952784,Drama in the ER,"Drama in the ER read. It's leans more towards erotica and drama with a Romance thrown in on the side. There are some typos that make you reread  the lines a few times, but it's still doable. I did not appreciate the ending ( didn't know it was a mini series). Carla is extremely naive for her age and painfully shy. Dr. Miller is hot and clueless when it comes to his past relationship with Tish.  There's plenty of drama and illicit activities in Kingdom Hospital with all of the characters and side dramas.Recommend to erotica fans. May be too much for traditional romance fans.

5951706,The music is better than the film!,"The Hours is a very good film, but the music is so good that it makes the film seem more extraordinary than it actually is. I saw it at a theatre and, as is usually the case, it was much more impressive than when seen at home. Those who have the soundtrack will notice that the music in the film is significantly different in some places; the songs are the same, but they have different effects, like glockenspeil.The only thing that would make this music better is if some of it would have a slower progression of ideas in the tracks. This issue is particularly apparent in the Solaris soundtrack (by Cliff Martinez), and less of a problem with this one. I've heard some Glass that I absolutely detest (Music in Twelve Parts) because it's so repetative and tacky. The music here is nothing like that. As another reviewer said, it's warm and the tempos are smooth, not forced.",5,1

Matt isn't immune, he's just protecting his heart. He doesn't get involved with a single Moms because when things don't work out he loses more than just the relationship, he loses the kids as well.Now, I've said this with each book in this series, the characters are real and so well written, complex but easy to understand. You feel connected and invested in every word!

It was around the same period as Hercules, Firefly, Xena, just after Brisco, Buffy...etc. Back when there were so many great action, adventure, comedy shows on TV. This one was more of a screwball comedy, harking back to the road shows of Hope and Crosby. The writing ranges from low brow to witty, yet always funny. I'm enjoying this show more now than it's original airing, perhaps due to the huge void in television created by sub par sitcoms and reality TV. It's a shame there aren't shows like this anymore.This show, is very funny, has entertaining adventure, and surprisingly great production values, anyone who enjoys comedy and adventure (and doesn't mind if it's played a little broad) will find this series to be an absolute treat.

If you are interested in learning about startups, even if you might not consider yours a ""high potential"" startup, it is still a must read.  This book takes you inside the startups and provides detailed information about how early decisions can have disasterous effects later in the life of the company.  It is research based and is NOT one of those ""start your own company and make a million dollars"" books.  The read is a little dry, but it is packed with valuable information.

It provides great information about a relatively unknown place in Japan, even to Japanese folks. It also chronicles a period of time in Japanese history from an unusual vantage point. The book is an excellent book for dog lovers, but it's about much more than that.

I loved Henry from the get go, he was funny and kind and such a great friend to Sydney.What I loved most was that I had no idea where Emma was going with the story, Sydney has some major issues because of her past and she is good at keeping them hidden; I was seriously worried for her throughout the story.I can't wait for the next installment.

It kept me glued and wondering where it was going to go next, although some parts of it you could figure out before they got there. The climax to me seemed to come more towards the end of the book and then just get wrapped up too quickly with things between Haller and Roulet. I think there could have been more twists and turns at that point and it could have been taken just a little bit farther. I was a tad disappointed with the ending, I felt that after all Michael Haller went through, he should have made a better career choice at the end ( hope I'm not giving too much away ). Now that I've read the book, I'm definitely ready to see the movie and I truly hope it lives up to the book.",5,1

1762442,Camel Club Personified,"David Baldacci has written a sequel to the Camel Club series in his usual remarkable form. The parallel action story-line was riveting. No author in my experience can successfully tell two completely separate stories at the same time, interspersing characters and activity at a micro level, as does Baldacci.Explaining the biography of Oliver Stone/John Carr in this book concerns me as an avid fan as to Baldacci's plans to continue the Camel Club series.  However, if he does not, the true enjoyment of having read all four books most assuredly allows me to give props the author deserves.Having introduced Annabelle as an addition to the group awhile back added a new dimension and certainly tickles the imagination of what might be, should future books be written. My recommendation is absolute, but it also includes reading the entire Camel Club series from the beginning.",4,1
8414456,Another big star for Micalea!!!,"I loved this series.  I actually love all of Micalea Smeltzer's work.  This series just snuck up on me and I don't know how.  It was just there.  I usually follow / stalk (you choose the word) her work and it was just there like a great big Xmas surprise!  It was a sweet and enjoyable story.  I loved it and the details that Micalea is so good at, make a great book into a memorable one.  When you read as much as I do, it is easy to have books sort of blend into each other over time (which is great because i can reread many of them) but she places details that keep her books in front and center.  I don't see a plaid shirt without thinking of Trace from these books. The grandfather, OH!!! who wouldn't wish for one of him  His character was so  heartwarming that he was as lovable as Trace - well almost...  Read this series and her others for yourself - I do not think you will walk away being anything other then another follower / stalker (you choose the word) like I am.",5,1

This one is OK, but not great.The good:You have access to a variety of puzzles, from USA Today to People to Newsday.The not so great:The navigation is poor.  You always seem to 'land' where you shouldn't be in the puzzle, cannot see the clues you want at the moment, and it's not easy to get back without a bunch of taps and disruption to your puzzle solving.It's very disruptive to the flow of your puzzle solving, and frustrating.",2,0

2239228,Thoroughly enjoyable.,I read elsewhere that Franklin was about 70 years of age before going to France as Embassador.  He was quick witted to be sure but a bit unpredictable for his French caretakers.  He left nothing for them in his will.  Isaacson did a wonderful job of reporting on Frankin's irascible character.,5,1

3574459,Fantastic book,"I feel that Kiana Davenport is in league with the great modern writers. She should be at least as well known as Barbara Kingsolver.  Her depth of characters, ability to explore the suffering of humanity, and the redemption that is found is stunning.Also, this book contains history of the civil war I had never known of such as the southern women growing poppies for the opium 'bullseyes' they used to prop up the soldiers for the war. Fascinating and profoundly moving, with great storyline. Davenport always well researches her novels to bring little known facts to the story. She is a great writer that leaves one deeply satisfied as a reader.",5,1
5736223,Great listening for a rainy day.,"Hayden's album, 'Everything I Long For', captures the simplicity of a man and his guitar at its best. His songs are unique in that each is a story. Excellent song writing abilities helps him to narrate his feelings and  experiences which are beautifully backed mostly by his acoustic guitar,  with some electric guitar, piano, cello and harmonica. A somewhat somber  album, however, Hayden is still able to capture the feelings most people  have sometime in their lives dealing with family and relationships. Two  such songs on the album, 'We don't mind', about a couple whom both call in  sick to work just so they can spend the day together, and 'Hardly', about  seeing someone you are attracted to, wanting to get to know them, but being  too afraid to go up to them and introduce yourself. These two songs happen  to be at the top of my most favorites. The whole album is equally enjoyable  and has a very relaxing overall effect. I listen to this album often and I  recommend it to anyone.",5,1
2651670,A gripping account of what it was like to be in the face of death,"I've read many books on the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States, but this is the first one I've read on the horrors that took place within the confines of the World Trade Center towers. It presents a gripping account of what it was really like for the individuals who faced death as they were trapped in the towers on that fateful day. This is an astounding story of courage and survival. The authors do an astounding job of detailing exactly what took place on that awful day. Be prepared for this book to have a significant impact on you, as it did for me. This is an essential book for anyone who lived through that horrible day in American history.",5,1
4249317,The Portable Patriot,"The Portable PatriotDocuments, Speeches, and Sermons That Compose the American SoulBy Joel Miller and Kristen ParrishThis book came around Memorial Day and I have taken the time to digest it.  It was a wonderful book full of different speeches and documents that trace America's Christian heritage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It was set up in chronological order and was a very interesting read.  It makes it easy to trace our heritage and also you can then look up time-lines and see what was going on in America's history at the time each document was made.  Also the authors put in background for the documents and speeches.  As it was original documents it has a very colorful and vivid language which we have lost.  It makes wonderful oral reading to share with older children.  As it is ""portable"" as it's name says it makes great reading in the car!!  It also makes some wonderful conversation starters for the family.  It is a book that I would recommend with much gusto!",5,1
9345022,Hilarious!,"Great movie continuing the trend for Dr Seuss films (with the sad exclusion of the live action Cat In The Hat).  This film departs from the recent trend to bring young children's books to the screen with live action (Grinch, Cat In The Hat, Where The Wild Things Are) and for good reason.  With the sole exception of the Grinch (possibly due to the incredible casting of that film), these books don't translate all that well into live action and leave the viewer wondering who they were made for.This doesn't do that.  It is lots of fun and while the territory has been plumbed by many others, this version of the envronmental/ecology story stands up very well.  Only Wall-E did it better.",5,1
1017221,Fun to read,"Christian fondlementalists notwithstanding, I believe anyone from their young teens to their early hundreds would enjoy this superb story. Pullman stuffed an entire Oxford education into his pipe and blew out a whopper. This isn't a science book, this is meant to be fun, so readers who understand what fantasy means will not quibble with the particle physics. The characters are outrageous and fascinating, and the worlds they live in are full of surprises. Throughout the trilogy and almost to the very end, Pullman continually adds layers to the story, making it a rich page-turner you will whip through with delight.",5,1

Oh god, the fantastic atmosphere that it creates alone is worth 10 stars. The acting is quite good, however if a few things were done differently, it would be just fantastic. I loved the plot, I never hear that many of Alices songs and I quite liked what he used in this movie. While the monster could have been improved, because it all just seemed as one big puppet (good looking, though), it wasn't quite that bad. So basically a few scenes could use improvement, but even without it, it's a fantastic movie!My wish for it to be released on blu-ray or 4K blu-ray!This is a movie for collection! Wow! Great stuff! Fantastic classic!",4,1

Hence, unless you are built like an underwear model or you are incredibly svelte, please do not flaunt yourself with this too-small swim suit.  So, the next question is why I bought it.  Well, I bathe my 2-year-old twin daughters by getting into the tub with them.  My regular trunks dripped all over the place when I got out of the tub.  I figured these would be better, and they are.  Still, I wouldn't be seen in public wearing these.  Though my waist fits fine, the leg openings are pretty small, and they press into my legs noticeably.",2,0

I would want to stay in the past but then I wanted to stay in the future. There is an entire life story here in the book. There is a second which I finished even before this review.Did I love it, I am not sure really but I am glad I read it, maybe I am having a hard time because it was so emotionally charged.",4,1
6852596,"Great keyboard, but takes some getting used to.","Just bought a Dell desktop and was amazed at how cheap their keyboards are. I selected the Arc to replace it. The smaller size takes some adjustment, but I am used to the laptop keypad, so this was not a big problem. After two days I'm quite happy with it. Only downside I can see is that the arrow keys are replaced with one toggle key. Takes some coordination. But again, nothing I can't adjust to. Would like to be able to find some mention of battery life. You can turn the keyboard on and off, but is it necessary? There is little said on the subject.I love the compact size, and the look of it. It's solidly built and very quiet (which was my biggest complaint about the Dell.) And the price is very reasonable compared to other models. I wish I had bought it through Amazon, but I was in a situation that I wanted it immediately, so the extra $15 or so that I paid for the list priced item was worth it.",4,1

Plot was highly original and will appeal especially to those who disapprove of the invasiveness of reporters (though the revenge in this case is harsher than deserved). Pacing was good, and kept me reading. Progress of the investigation was credible. Characters were interesting and intelligent. Ending is a nail-biter and highly satisfying.Two negatives in my opinion: some gratuitous cursing; also I've read mysteries that are slightly more uniformly gripping, though I'd put this one in the top quartile for ""grippingness"".Very entertaining. At $2 it was a great deal, too. I highly recommend it.",4,1

Meticulously documented and footnoted, Livingstone names names and compiles events in Dallas as they most probably occured. A great addition to his previous works has a little repetition and although he discusses the Tippet murder may have several reasons, I believe Henry Hurt's to be the most plausible.  This book is a must read for anyone with serious interest in the case.  Great job, Harry, Sincerely,  Chris Petit",5,1

I never thought I would be a fan of Josh Groban but I saw him on PBS one and I was blown away.  He rotates proudly in my CD player and gets jammed in my car.  I really enjoy him!  I can't wait to see him live!  He is so amazing on CD and television I might pass out from his wonderfulness at the concert!  I recommend everyone give him a chance he proudly sits in my music collection.  And is right next to CDs that are not even in his genre-punk- so I suggest everyone give him a chance the clips on here are an good introduction to Josh's music, but if you are still debating I would check him out at your library or record store and you will be so amazed you will buy his CD right away!",5,1

The commentaries can be occasionally boring, or at least completely unaware of the stuff that fans would want to hear about.

2427639,Even Better Than the Last Entry in the Series,"Really quite happy with this Simply Sarah series. In addition to hitting all the marks for the targeted reading ability group, the author effortlessly incorporates other contemporary themes that were oddities when I was young reader.In this book we meet Sarah once again, who lives with her single mother and young brother. This time the reader gets to meet a friend who is living with her aunt and uncle because her parents died in an earthquake. This is in addition to the last book of getting to know Peter who lives with his grandmother. These dynamics are ones that are reflective of the familiar situations of many of the likely readers of this story and it's excellent that so many children will have an opportunity to identify with one or more characters.As with the other book, Sarah once again has a 'problem' and once again goes about thinking in a variety of critical ways to solve it.Really shaping up to be a cute and enduring series for the young, confident reader.",4,1

It was a good pro wrestling pay-per-view.I got a kick out of watching the DVD extra that showed the fans at the T.N.A. Fanfest standing in line and then later meeting the wrestlers.

1907300,Challenging in many ways,"This is a challenging and difficult book in many senses. It challenges our beliefs, whether we hold firmly to a version of God, or to a secular faith in no God. It challenges us whether we see science as the only Way, or doubt science as the way. It is a work of science, religion, faith, doubt, philosophy, and ethics, humanism and humanity. It challenges us because the thinking and feeling are deep and challenging in themselves. It is challenging because sometimes, like Kant, Kauffman seems unnecessarily dense in his writing. But this is a book well worth reading, no matter where you begin, or end.",5,1

Luckily I was proven wrong.  ""Pink"" was a breezy refreshing read.  The characters seemed real, not preachy or annoying and actually relatable.  It was very cool to find out what goes on inside the fashion design world and how a small business operates.  And it was very nice to to see the story from Flex's POV and not just assuming what he was thinking from Raya.  Looking foward to reading Jade!",5,1
4655214,Where's the rest of it?,"I had high hopes for this book.  Firstly, I love any lycan story, but I also like my characters to have backbone.  By that I mean, they don't just willingly believe you without putting up a fight to figure things out themselves. Secondly, there was no development of the characters really.  It was a hey-I'm-a-wolf-you're-my-mate-let's-get-busy.  There was supposed to be a big fight scene, though when it boiled down to it, was nothing more than a few paragraphs.I got this as a freebie book, I was a little interested in what happens to the characters because of the abrupt ending.  You're reading along expecting to meet the pack, expecting so much more and BAM!  You're at the end of the book. Admittedly, I don't think I paid any attention to the length of this book. I would love to find out what happened to the characters, but I'm not going to pay $2.99 for 90 more pages. Not when I could spend the same for a book with 345 pages and a better story line.  I feel like this title just left the readers hanging.",2,0

1564756,A biography that reads like a thriller,"Before Captain Cook left on his first Voyage of Discovery, 40% of the Earth's surface had not been mapped.  By the time he died - eaten by the Hawaiians, with only his thigh bone and uneated hands, one of them bearing a recognizable scar, delivered back to the ship - he had mapped essentially all of the unknown surface of the Earth.  This biography is beautifully written.  A few months ago I was sitting at a bar in Cook Islands, reading this book, and a local said to me that he had bought about 20 copies to hand out to his boatie friends.  You are in for hours of discovery and enjoyment.",5,1

1299483,Twisted and Dark FBI story - not a romance!,Twisted story of suspense. A serial killer is killing women in an exceptionally gruesome way. He tortures and plays with them first. He then leaves them wrapped in plastic for the law to find. The FBI is brought in and the killer steps it up by taunting the cops by leaving bodies close to their homes and lives. I knew by about the end of the second chapter who the bad guy was. It was frustrating to see the characters play so dumb to the clues I obviously figured out. Good book but very dark with lots of death. Not for those with a weak stomach. One of the better books I've read this month.,4,1
8924810,Great movie!,"This is a great example of the early 80s Euro-gore movies. I saw it at the drive-in when it came out, and then ob VHS as Dr Butcher MD. There is a lot of grain in the movie, especially in the darker scenes, which is typical of movies shot on film. I think this enhances the viewing experience. Down with digital and CGI, this is what a horror movie should look like.",5,1
2467600,Inspiration at its best,"An inspiring story of how faith can guide you in the most desperate of situations. Ms. Tuff gave insight to her inner most feelings and how her faith helped her in her life and how she used what she believed in to help someone else.  It was not only a story of a critical situation at a school with a possible horrible outcome, but a touching story of a woman who put aside all her own personal adversities to help someone else.I enjoyed the joining of two stories-one being the trying times of a wonderful woman & one of a helpless young man--as a truly great read.",5,1

It only has 6 songs, but for 6 bucks it's a good deal. And every  song is good. I highly recommend this cd. If you like Borgir or Simon  Dimmu, this would be an excellent alternative. What's most catching is how  good and talented they are, for a new band that is young. If you like hard  metal that's a different than what's average get this cd.",5,1

Sarah DeAnna's informative, funny yet kind voice throughout really speaks to women who are bombarded by images of 'perfection' day in and day out.

1062876,Perfect book,"I was absolutely hooked from the first chapter. I devoured the book. It's the fastest I've ever finished a book as I tend to have ADD and take longer than 2 weeks go finish even a great novel. This book was so fun to read. And interesting and emotional. I really connected with the characters. It's not so detailed that the book becomes long, draggy and uninteresting. It stays young, fun, and fresh from page 1 through the end. There were times at the end of most sections, the author would absolutely leave me at the edge of my seat yearning for more info.  Highly recommended. Love Madeleine's style!",5,1

4973721,"""Super"" heroes","I am really becoming a fan of the ""Beat To a Pulp"" series, and this installment is a good reason to be.  From characters that are super-powered to normal people in extraordinary circumstances, ""BTAP-Superhero"" is a gritty, sometimes hyper-violent look into these characters lives. Admittedly, this is a little different than most hard-boiled, pulp fiction, but definitely in a good way. I recommend it!",4,1
5321662,It deserves 4 1/2,This is a very clever story of a post apocalyptic - outer space type.  There is a somewhat type love interest goingon in the background but that really does not play a big role.  I was hooked from the start when the main characterwakes up with no memories on a ship full of dead people.  There of course is a lot of gore and crazy creatures - conspiracytheories and military bases and the military portions are very realistic.

6651968,Quality construction. Very bad instructions.,"1st I would like to thanks amazon for making purchase of TV mount so easy, based on reviews. I didn't compare this one with anything else. Simply picked it up based on the fact that it was #1 seller at that time with good reviews.Also noticed that few people complained about instructions being very vague. I can concur with them. Instructions are vague. It won't say which parts to use for Concrete walls VS what to use for drywall. Their attempt to provide graphical representation of installation procedure does help a little bit, but it can be improved. It costs 1 star from review.About the mount itself, it is built solid. Once mounted on wall, feels secure, sturdy that I can trust my expensive LED to it. Comes with Quality HDMI cable about 10 ft. All in all, good purchase.",4,1

474845,A life challenged and changed,I enjoyed this book more than the other by Laura Hillenbrand.  I enjoyed hearing the events that shaped his life in his own words.

This case is perfect for those occasions when I want to use the pen only. I'm left handed, and it works fine in that orientation. The only downside is that the stand is not stable in the 'low rise' configuration: Normal pressure of fingers on screen will make the flap slip out of position and the stand will collapse. This can be fixed by pulling the elastic strap behind the vertical part of the low rise stand, which keeps everything snugly in place, but it puts quite a strain on that strap.",4,1

8777401,Misogyny and lousy direction sink movie,"This film doesn't just pale in comparison to its cyberpunk cousins &quot;Bladerunner&quot; or &quot;12 Monkeys,&quot; it turns ghostly white and dies.  The film misses the mark because it can't decide what it's aiming for, and so it resorts to tired old Hollywood formulas.  For example, the film nominally decries misogyny while at the same time offering viewers voyeuristic scenes of women being murdered, raped, groped, and screwed. (And that's when they're not stripping and standing around 90-100% nude.) Bassett's strength gives the movie some female force, but only by putting her macho boots up the noses of the bad guys and gals.  Interestingly, the film portends the LA police's CRASH unit--a murderous group of fascists which has come to public light since this film was made.  But that real story of CRASH is far more horrifying than this weak drama.",2,0

What happened to Sebastien after his solo bus ride really made me wonder several times. I devoured this book in one long all day/night session and was absolutely enchanted. I have read a few reviews that liked the first book better but I disagree and think the masterpiece is in Fugue State. Talk about redemption, overcoming obstacles and learning to live a life that didn't start with a solid foundation. I'll be thinking of this book for a long time.",5,1

More like a running catalog of no-restriction shopping and over-done curtains -- always a bad sign -- and to make matters even worse, it's all photographed in absurdly overly-propped settings, better suited to a cook book than to the work of, dare I repeat it, ""American's Best Designers.""Compared to Jan Shower's excellent ""Glamorous Rooms,"" which arrived at the same time, this one would be a profound disappointment if it weren't just so -- silly.Recommendation: Avoid at all costs.

It was actually a movie, ""The Good Girl"" with Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gylenhall, that prompted me to finally sit down and read this book. First of all, the book has no plot. Second of all, I'd heard all about Holden's teen angst but it seemed less angst more teen obnoxiousness to me. Holden was a bored, spoiled, rich kid who didn't like anything. That's basically the essence of the book. Still, as much as I tried not to, I liked the book. I chuckled and smiled and looked forward to reading Holden's ""take"" on the world around him even though I thought he was a bit of a phony.",4,1
8604312,No one puts baby in a corner,"I love this film and this disc, which looks great on my very good HD projector.  I don't get why the stars are not listed in the Amazon info, though, and why the older, 2000 dvd is labeled blu-ray.I was right outa college in 1963, and summered in a similar place. The spirit and sound of the film are period perfect.  Swayze and Grey are a perfect film couple; they are sympathetic characters with great chemistry.  The standard Hollywood conventions and devices mount up by the end, spoiling the ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  For a while, though, you can forget this is a Hollywood movie.  Regardless of its increasing implausibility as the film barrels along, I still felt tears well up at the finale.",4,1

By ""magic"" the dots react to the kids movements and actions.  I have a 3 year old son who just loves this book - he's charmed by all the action and loves being part of the story.

The story and plot was very enjoyable, but what made the book awesome to me was the fact that Tabitha, the main lady character was not perfect in her looks. She was not drop dead gorgeous, she had some insecurities, but she still has spunk and drive and spirit. I liked the twist on the very frequently told story of a gorgeous man meets and falls for a gorgeous room man. Life does not work that way and it's good to read a story like this.",5,1

6571981,Works like a charm,"After researching what modems were compatible with Comcast, I picked this one.  I decided to buy rather than rent from the cable company.  It came, I took it out of the box, hooked it up and after a rather long call with Comcast (not the modem's fault) everything was up and running.  Added an airport extreme, and my house is now wireless with a very fast connection.  Totally satisfied with this product, have had it for about 6 weeks with ZERO problems/issues.",5,1

3145065,Great Fantasy Read!!,"""The Estian Alliance"" is the spectacular conclusion to the Jake West trilogy which will take you on the ride of your life. This story is full of action, adventure and twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Jake, Ben and the remainder of the Estian Alliance, after their near defeat at Dassilliak, have retreated to Te'oull with King Vantrax's evil army hot on their trail. Jake still needs to restore the box of stones to receive his full power as Keeper which will hopefully be the advantage they need to win this war. The Heynai have told Jake that this will be the final battle. Is Jake up to the challenge and will the Estian Alliance be strong enough to defeat King Vantrax and his evil army once and for all?The author does an excellent job of drawing you into this story through his vivid descriptions which make you feel as if you are on the battle field, too. If you are looking for a fantasy packed with action suitable for all ages then this is the book for you.",4,1

1183755,Enter Stormlord !!,"New type fantasy book with some mystery thrown in. Extreme readability. I want to buy the next book as soon as possible.A Stormlord is someone who brings rain. He is the most valuable person in the world. Only one Stormlord remains and he is dying. If he dies, civilization must perish.This book is about Shale; outcast boy from a poor village who might be the next Stormlord. Important people want to use him for their own evil ends and Shale must learn to make his own way in the world.The supporting cast is Terelle; a slave girl fleeing the life of a courtesan. She has mysterious powers which might rival that of a Stormlord.I like this book because the Shale and Terelle are just ordinary people trying to live ordinary lives but having a hard time of it because they were born to poor circumstances. Also they have their dreams. Shale might become the next Stormlord and Terelle might be something that rivals a Stormlord. It is very easy to relate to them.",5,1
4628386,another page turner,"Another great story by my favorite author, Lori Leger. I really enjoy Lori's style of writing, very descriptive, and well developed characters. Each book feels like it's written about friends I know and care about. I have read every book Lori has written and can't wait until her next one. I happen to love country music and Lori writes songs or artists names into the story and this one she even made some online friends characters in the story. I especially love how she writes 4 year old Buck's words, because he can't say his &#34;r's she writes them as &#34;w's&#34; as a small child would sound. This book deals with a Marine, and is very well described about how some military may deal with PTSD and adjusting to life at home.  I highly recommend any of Lori's books and Meagan's Marine is one of the very best!",5,1

1060715,An awesome literary example of absurdity!,"As I read other reviews of this books, specifically the reviews by those who rated it so poorly, I have to wonder if many people missed the point that Burroughs was undoubtedly trying to make. This book is full of absurdities. It's rare for someone to write so effortlessly about such utter reckless abandonment of priorities and the basics of our humanity. This book, from beginning to end, is absolutely ridiculous. The characters (showing how talented Burroughs truly is) are believable, their obsessions, insecurities and the messes they get into, mirror those of average people. Burroughs manages to tell an incredibly cruel, absurd and gross tale that perfectly depicts the plight of so many but under an extra-bright spotlight and in a frame of a big, sparkly, fake grin.",4,1
8054632,Easily a Reread Kind of Book,"I read this a few years ago, and didn't realize that I'd already read it when I purchased it for my kindle. Oh well, it was just as good as I remembered.

1068829,What a read!,"I actually sought this book out after watching the sleeper movie adaptation of it (co-written by the author) that's been playing on cable. The movie stayed very close to the book, though some of the secondary characters' detail was either cut from the final or not fleshed out. But there's so much going on in the book that relates to the desires of adults not wanting to embrace their responsibilities both as parents and partners. Perrotta's sparse writing style packs a wallop though. You feel like you're in the room, whether it's during the intimacy of a sexual tryst between the characters or during the discomfort they feel at a dinner party with their spouses. There's a lot to like and learn from here, while the tale weaves in and out of dark humor and ironic passages. Check this book out. I look forward to now reading Election (which became the brilliant Reese Witherspoon/Matthew Broderick film) and Joe College.",5,1

8587423,"Strong performances, tragic story","This tale of the fashion industry, and how it uses, abuses, and discards its participants, features strong performances. First, Angelina Jolie, as the brassy, sassy, and ultimately pitiful figure of Gia, as well as Mercedes Ruehl, as her mother, and others, make this a tragic tale of a girl, who makes it big; then self-destructs, facing what was then the largely unknown disease which was, and still is, Aids.  Not for everyone but a good movie.  There is an unrated version; which I'm not sure what more could be added, as this ""R"" rated one features quite a bit of controversial material (Nudity, Lesbianism, Drug Use). Not a upbeat movie but a moral fable for modern times.",4,1
8985140,The Queen,"A truly great collaboration starring the Queen of Horror & a supporting cast as good as she.

A lot of times I am bombarded with an over load of information that I just can't fully process before they move on to the next subject, leaving me bewildered and befuddled. The &#34;mastery series&#34; isn't like that. Each book breaks down an integral part of your camera. It focuses on that part. How it works, why it works, how to make it work they way you want it to!

5296649,Good book. Excellent plot.,"I enjoyed Kevin's first foray into published word. Excellent plot, great characters. Could even see Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad playing the lead in the movie version. If I had to critique the story, I would say the last third of the book seemed a bit rushed. Plot moved too fast to reach its conclusion. Only other criticism would be that Mr. Sheridan needs to flesh out his characters and settings more. One of the reasons I love Dan Brown and Tracy Chevalier is their unique way of making you feel you can see the setting and the physical characteristics of the people in the story. Other than that, a terrific book.",4,1

The two new chapters add to its value- and are so entertainingly written that I even stayed awake for the bit about short-form versus long-form DRTV. (The new media chapter merits a book in itself though- why not go for it, Luke?) Meanwhile this book comfortably retains the title of the best all-round book on the business. Thanks again.",5,1

829024,"Shines in its plausible plot, in details and suspense","If we are not fearful enough, than Fredrick Forsyth reminds us that the terrorists have the money, the skills and, most importantly, the patience needed to meticulously plan horrific acts designed to destroy our open societies. Although more of a history lesson than the traditional thriller, The Afghan shines in its plausible plot, in details and suspense.When the British and the American intelligent services learn of a plot known only as Al-Isra (the enlightenment of Mohammad), they conceive of a daring plan to infiltrate Al-Qaeda. They recruit the recently retired Col Mike Martin (of the superb Fist of God) to impersonate Izmat Khan, an Afghan Taliban commander. From Afghanistan of the 1980s to the Saudi-financed maddarasses in Pakistan where young men are brainwashed into hatred, Forsyth trails the rise of the Islamic terror groups. Still the master of the spy genre, Forsyth has the exceptional ability to transform dry data into an engaging story. Chilling.",5,1

I wondered.The excellent features of this book include the ""In Your Notebook"" sections where you can try out the techniques and strategies Mayes has just explained.  I also really enjoy the variety of poets  whose works are introduced.However, there are some moments where there is so much detail that I found myself losing interest and not retaining as much.  In that respect, it really showed Mayes background with a university-type audience.It is definitely worth it to have on any aspiring poet's shelf.

2243633,Tedious,"I will say off the bat that I only read 1/3 of this book.  I thought the story sounded great--middle aged widow tries to find a new life for herself, but the author introduced so many characters and all their junk that it took away from the story.

767161,Even if its a classic that doesn't make it good.,I had to read this book for summer reading and it was complete torture.  It was the first story in America to be done in venecular which made it a classic and hard to read.  some how his adventures are nothing but dull are semi-stupid.  Huck is not a perfect character and all his flaws seem to be over looked.  Jim is merely in the story because he needs to be and although he is not a brilliant person mark twain has not given the slave fair credit by making an unschooled boy half his age seem twice as smart.  His story also implied that southerns are stupid just by the way they talk amoung other things.  The story ends leaving you unsatisfied with what you that the main character should have learned.

I figured it was a spiritual journey of sorts.Sadly, the second part of the book was absolutely awful and was a total let-down. The guy is in an nuthouse and he does not improve. I did not care about him, his mentally-retarded child (I know that phrase is not politically correct, but it is proper if you actually know what the word means), his should-have-been ex-wife, or any of the other characters. Nobody is fleshed out in this absolutely incomprehensible book.There is one amazing positive about this book: The word FRUGALITY is an acronym for the way one should live life.

One tip -- do not leave it on standby when you're not using it. Turn it off every time until the next time you use it. If you leave it on standby, the battery gets used up in a day or two quickly.",5,1

I had a hard time believing that a girl that had grown up with money would actually enjoy cool whip.... nor that a degree in U.S. law would be easily translated into a career in Italian law.  Italy and United States are two different countries and different Judicial systems.  Sex scenes were at least mostly believable.  I might try other books by this author if the price was right.",2,0

8675929,Dietrich in a surprising role that revitalized her career,"Wonderful stuff from two unlikely leads. Jimmy Stewart plays Tom Destry, a deputy sheriff who is quiet and reserved, and doesn't believe in gunplay, even in this wild, wild western town of Bottleneck. Marlene Dietrich plays Frenchy, the barroom belle who's in cahoots with the town swindler until she is won over by Stewart. She dies in his arms at the end, taking a bullet meant for him.Dietrich's career was on the skids when she took this unlikely rough-around-the-edges role, and the success of the film made her a star again. When she sings ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have,"" the answer is obvious - and has nothing to do with booze. Stewart is excellent as the unassuming, soft-smiling deputy - a man with ""personality"" who is always being reminded of a story he once heard or knew. The bit parts are played to the hilt, to great effect. The picture is excellently paced and great fun to watch.",5,1

9192546,Pretty close to perfect.,"As a kid, I loved the original series. I had all of the figures and VHS tapes of the show. So, we I first heard that they were remaking the series, I was super excited. For the most part, this is great, really top notch. But, my main issue is with the voice actors they chose for some of Skeletor's crew. They are HORRIBLE. Not only does Clawful, Beast Man, and Mer-Man sound goofy and dumb, they're just straight up obnoxious. It sounds so unbelievably kiddish, it's hard to listen to at times. If only they could redo the voices for those characters, it'd be perfect in my opinion. The action, storylines, and characters themselves are great. Orko gets a little annoying at times, but he's not in it much. And some dialogue is cheesy, but it's a cartoon, I'm not expecting Oscar worthy dialogue. But I am expecting the voices to match the style and edginess of it. Overall, it's great for fans of the original and new fans getting into them.",4,1

I love the scenes that are set on this album and the songwriting.  Bruce bares his soul about relationships and it is such a heart wrenching record.  Favorite cut is Valentine's Day, my hair still raises every time I hear that Beautiful, Beautiful song. I like all the other songs on this album too except for Aint Got You. I usually skip it. Spare Parts makes me want to dance. Walk Like A Man talks about being a man(ready or not), Brilliant Disguise is just wonderful, Two Faces talks about different personalities we all have, Tougher Than the Rest talks about hearts being stomped on and becoming hard.

Gibson seems to be pissed off he accepted the role, the ""Boston"" accent is annoying, the movie is clearly a half hour too long and, typical of movies like this, the characters fearing for their lives all do predictably stupid things.  Two and a half stars for the kernel of an idea for a good movie and a few good action sequences.  Unfortunately this one is pretty much a paint by the numbers affair with a lot of long boring sceens of faux acting used as filler for a weak story.  Save your money and rent if you must.",2,0

The illustrations are very real and pull the reader in. The back section features a ""Creative Minds"" educational section. Younger kids can learn so much from reading the story, while older kids gain knowledge from the excellent resources and Q&A; sections in the back.Resources:The last six pages of the book are an amazing resource and even more can be found at the Sylvan Dell Publishing website.",5,1

I recognized many of the situations that occured in the first Wifey, because similar situations really occured in the Norfolk/ Virginia Beach area, during the late 80's and early 90's.

However, I'm getting into time lapse HDR movies now and focus stacking macro shots just because... I CAN now.  :-)Quality is very good.  There are rubber ""caps"" over the interface plugins which seem to me might fail after a lot of use but I'm not positive of that.  Definitely get a camera compatible promote systems shutter release cable also so you can use all of the features of this tool. Without the shutter release the bracketed shots are fired off slower and MUP functionality is not available.

It is an inexpensive watch and I don't expect much for $40, but the watch looks nice and is quite light. The caveat is that it is light because it's all plastic.  It's not a precise watch, the minute hand doesn't line up exactly, the bezel of course doesn't move so it's useless, and just for looks. I only buy solar watches, and with the digital calendar, alarms, and timer, its quite remarkable, because even the most expensive watches really don't provide any more information. But the workmanship is what you expect for this price watch. It's great for bumming around in. The band is also less than stellar, but functional. I watched a you-tube to find out how to resize the band. I recommend the watch, but don't expect a high quality Citizen, or other quality watch...it is what it is, a good watch for the price...Get It.",4,1

If you must read it, borrow it from your local library.  Kiyosaki doesn't have much to say, contrary to what his proponents write.  His main message, be financially smart and pay attention to how you spend your money, is simply common sense and not a great revelation.  Beyond that, the book is vague and somewhat suspicious.  His tale of the rich dad makes one think that it is a fabrication.  Kiyosaki writes about the rich dad in such a formless manner that it seems plausible that the rich dad is purely imaginary.  The book just isn't worth the time it takes to read it, definitely not worth the praise some people have heaped upon it.",1,0

It's really has nothing to do with the series (book or manga) and has very little in common with the first film.Still I'm really glad I got the set.

The movie emasculates the interesting ideas found in the novel.  One of the novel's themes concerns the use of power or knowledge by those who haven't earned the right to use it.

When he meets the heroine, Jolie Benoit, the life he's found is turned upside down. Through both of these stories Hauk and Jolie vow to be ""just friends,"" which sends the sexual tension off the charts. The underground Austin setting--literally in the steam tunnels under the University of Texas--is novel and fun. This series will continue with more stories and has become an auto-buy for me. And at a price point of $1.99 for the first story (clocking in at a little less than 40,000 words), How Beauty Met the Beast is a great deal!",5,1

Owen has a rare genetic disorder and Haatchi was hit by a train.  Thus, they both have faced tremendous physical and psychological problems.  Together, though, they have conquered those problems one after another. There undoubtedly will be plenty more to conquer, but this book wisely shows it's best to live and love in the present, don't dwell on the past, and don't waste your days worrying about the future.  Moreover, life is much easier to navigate if you have a best friend to travel with you, especially one who shares your problems and gives you unconditional love.*Lean on Me (Single Version)",4,1

I went in with low expectations and was not disappointed. To be succinct, its pure crap. There is not a whit of independent research or new information. Its merely a compilation of superficial news reports that was probably thrown together over a long weekend to capitalize on O'Reilly's iconoclastic reputation from Fox news. The CD version has O'Reilly droning on as if he's reading from a phone book. I borrowed the book(CDs) from my local library so I couldn't send the discs Frisbee-style across the highway, but that is the only fate they deserve.This book is such a POS I suspect O'Reilly must be really desperate for cash to put his name on it.

7528902,Definitely not a gimmick.,"I have always washed my salad greens and shook them out in a dishcloth--this works fine but the salad spinner is definitely a convenience tool.  What I like about it--I can put a whole container of lettuce in the basket, rinse it, spin it, use what I need and store the rest in the fridge. Depending on the type of lettuce, it generally needs about 3 spins.  I empty the water left in the bowl after spinning, but I think leaving the water on the bottom might keep the salad crisper. I don't think it really makes a difference. It keeps for days and I just re-rinse and re-spin when I need more.  The lettuce is kept perfectly crisp and fresh.  There really isn't anything I dislike--it is big, but it fits on the bottom shelf of our fridge and it stores nicely in our pantry when not in use.  I thought it might be too big for 2 people, but it isn't.  I am sure the smaller one would work just as well and I may get that for herbs or veggies.  A very handy tool, and not a gimmick.",5,1

Speeds were acceptable to my equipment.  That said, you will have issues with this adapter using Windows 8.  It required me to uninstall/re install the adapter at least once a day until I finally searched the www for a reason.  If you disable the N protocol in the device settings, it will work fine... but that sucks not having the N connection I often transfer large files over the wifi network).  So I rolled back the two laptops I have this adapter in to Windows 7.  It's an older adapter so I can understand it's a end of life.  Would buy again for a Windows 7/Vista/XP/LINUX laptop.",5,1
2883897,Disappointing,"As I was reading this, I kept shaking my head.  This book didn't really give me a lot of help.  There really isn't much in here that I couldn't find in a lot of other, much better, books.  I found the advice to be plain wrong in some cases, ill-advised in others.  And the author's attitude bothered me.  It was off-putting.It wasn't a really horrible book, which is why it got two stars, but I've read books that gave me a lot more help.  If you're insistent on buying this book, though, my copy will be up for sale.  :)",2,0

2059877,Excellent Survey of How Catholicism is Rooted in Judaism,"Often ignored is the tenet that Christianity is the fulfillment of Judaism, not simply a new religion that attempted to replace it. Catholic theology, tradition and liturgy are steeped in their Jewish heritage. I am a Christian priest, so I have a Mezuzah on my doorpost to remind me of that. Taylor Marshall has presented a simple but thorough examination of the major details of these roots. I would give the book five stars if he had paid more attention to the point that both Judaism and Catholicism are religions of Covenant. I recommend this book, especially to those who focus on the blond, blue-eyed, non-Semitic Jesus.",4,1

We plan to visit the coast all the way up to Kirkenes in the Arctic Circle.  Rick Steves touches on Bergen in the south, and that is it.I would recommend buying a different guidebook for full coverage of Norway.",1,0
1362938,So real,"I'm not going in to the synopsis for the book since it's been covered.  I wanted to comment on the author.  I love that she was able to grasp the realism of high school drama.  I actually knew people like this when I was in high school.  The friends who stood by you know matter what, the friends who stopped being your friends because of the silliest (looking back it's silly - at the time, a significant ordeal) things.I particularly liked Noah.  The author did a really good job of getting into his head.(Slight spoiler): It makes you wonder about kids who use pot.  Some of them do it because they have nothing to do, but perhaps others do it to forget things that are too depressing to think about.The pacing was good, the conversations realistic.  I think Katie McGarry will go on to do wonderful things.  I hope we get to see more of Noah and Echo in future books.",5,1

This compilation covers his 30+ years very well, although Id personally include a few songs like &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;country comfort&quot;. Also, where is the border song? It was on the 70s hits album and I cant see why such a great song was ommitted here. Still,  nitpicking aside this album is enjoyable from beginnig to end.

The first half of our lives is always more innocent and dependent than the second half and  Karleen Koen captured that brilliantly.  Again, I hated finishing this  book, because reading her works make you feel as if you are right  there...the best friend of Barbara.

Once I started reading the story I could just really picture what Mr. Bonilla was explaining as he descibes things very well so well you'll find it hard to set the book down. I was very curious to find out what was going to happennext. It's a futuristic tale of a brutal civil war between the people of the USA and it's own government so you can just imagine what it would be like when the dust settles, how people continue to survive. I think it would make a great movie! Well done I enjoyed it.",4,1

These actually fit the bill quite well for me.  They fit comfortably in my ear and while I still don't like wearing them for long periods, they are very soft and non-irritating.  The sound quality is very good at any volume and I was pleasantly surprised with how well they block ambient noise.  The earbuds look stylish with white cords and silvery tips on the earpieces themselves.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend it.",4,1

There is something in his flavor that just speaks to me...takes me back to something inside of me that is long ago and far away...I get to peek at that thing again with Maxwell's music.  I don't know how he does it, but I think he understands that love is better hidden in the shadows a bit --- whispered and not necessarily shouted out...the kind of love that you can feel coming from miles away, but you just can't see it yet.

Other than that, I'm not sure why Zebrowski, Dolph, et. al. were even in the book.  The plot was basically an excuse to go from one sex scene to another.

The mystery and what ifs kept me turing the page.And the editing was amazing, which is pretty uncommon with self-published authors. But after checking out Amy Bartol's blog, I know why. She pays to have it professionally edited...she is truly dedicated to putting out a Fabulous piece of work. I am grateful for her efforts!!!I am just overwhelmed with how much I loved this book.

7577909,Best trash can brand,"This is the second simplehuman trash can we've purchased, and it's the only brand we buy when we want great quality.  They're not cheap, but there's a reason for that.  The stainless steel doesn't collect fingerprints, and the lids seal tight enough to keep out smells.  We actually keep this in our twins' bedroom and unless the can is actually open, you can't smell anything at all.  Once the lid closes, the smell goes away.  (It's a more practical solution than buying a Diaper Genie that you'll never use once your kids are grown.)  I like the simplehuman trash bags, since they're really thick, but the white, 13 gallon Hefty ones fit just fine if you tuck some of it in the hole in the back.  The simplehuman trash bags don't work so much better that I feel the need to buy them instead.",5,1

6116170,Disappointed,"I went to the NY-Reprise website to see about doing the pre-order and was able to see the songs included.  While there is some stuff not included in the Buffalo Springfield Boxset (a major disappointment after all the years I waited for it), again there is quite of bit of previously-released material here.  Do I really need one more version of the same song I have on my vinyl disc, my original CD, my remastered CD, and my boxset?  And there are a bunch.  Check out the site.  If you want this for, especially, the BS stuff, and you have all the previously released BS stuff, I believe the title of this review is appropriate.  Some remixes, some mono releases, the previously released live shows.  Where is the long Bluebird?  Where are the live BS songs?  I bought the box, I will not be buying this.  I'm done.",1,0

918690,Best Sonchai thriller yet!,I loved this fourth book in the series better than any of the previous (and I would give all of them five stars). This novel has more twists and turns than usual and gives the reader a lot more to think about in its own quirky way. Sonchai Jitpleecheep is my favorite fictional detective yet!,5,1

9087074,Interesting Thriller from Argentina,This film is unique in its approach.  Who would ever expect an epileptic introverted taxidermist of participating in a huge heist?  The acting is solid and the film draws you in wondering what possesses the protagonist to get in way over his head criminally.  It also shows how southern Argentina has forests much like North America and Europe; not something you often see in films.  Good solid film.,4,1

4886334,Cute Romance,I enjoyed this book. It was what I consider your 'A Typical' romance but it was well written and the characters were developed nicely. I found the plot to be somewhat predictable but I enjoyed Patricia Ryan's writing and how the characters were woven together. If you're looking for a feel good romance I definitely recommend this book.,4,1
1487277,A Big Let Down,I went into this book expecting great things. What I got instead was a train wreck of a book. The plot and character development lazily wander their way through the pages. This ended up with me never really caring that much about either.As for the ending of the book it was one of the worst ones I have read. The sense of disappointment and frustration as I read the last page was huge. After investing so much time in this book it felt like I was being forced to read the next book in the series just to get closure and some clarification of the first book.  I mean the author sent so much time building up to what promised to be an exciting conclusion only for it to end up people basically walking off into the setting sun.This is the first time I have read a Hugo award winning novel that did not deliver. Let&#8217;s hope it is the last one. I for one will not be finding out what happens next as I really don&#8217;t care.,2,0

9096012,9/11 in the making,"'The Hamburg Cell' is an excellent film that follows the 9/11 hijackers in the years leading up to the attacks. The film is simple, yet extremely compelling. The acting is superb, and the characters are portrayed not as frothing at the mouth lunatics, but as the rather ordinary-albeit demented-young men that they were. The film succeeds in showing how one can go from a shy, secular, college student, to an angry, brainwashed, religious zealot. From the several books that I have read on the subject, the film seems to be very accurate. Conspiracy theories notwithstanding, this is the true story of the 9/11 hijackers and how they came to be the most infamous men of our generation. I highly recommend this film.",5,1
5514747,Interesting Plot,"As a variation, this was not a typical rehash of the P&P plot but a reasonable change in circumstances that lead E and D to meet in a foreign country and encounter a few dangers.  These adventures also cause them to abandon the straight-laced morality of the 1800s as they forge their relationship.  Don't worry.  Darcy is still the hero and Elizabeth our heroine.  It kept my interest throughout.",4,1

7938776,Great quick read,"While the hashing out of past baggage intruded a bit into the developing romance between the two leads, overall this novella was fun, satisfying and sexy. In short order, the author manages to create two characters we care about and a relatively believable romantic/sexual relationship. Maybe it's a bit fanciful to think so much love could develop in such a short time, but this is fiction and the thing that makes it such great escape. Good enough that I ordered the follow-up book that tells the friend Luke's story. Recommended.",4,1

Her energetic powerful voice makes me believe that nothing is impossible.  I enjoyed the track Summertime.  Her voice has an awesome sultry sexy quality on this track.  Fantasia sings  a classic Chain of Fools with the right kind of sassiness and attitude and makes it her own.  I loved listening to this CD.,5,1

507314,Our Greatest Gift: Meditation on Dying and Caring,Henri Nouwen provides a well thought out view on dying.  His concern is that we should treat dying as a normal part of living and we should examine our relationship with God.  Death is a beautiful entrence to the Kingdom of Heaven and should be considered the next step in our life with God.  This is an excellent book for those in ministry who work with families who are in grief due to the death of a loved one. The material provides background that may be utilized during funerals and consoling family members.,5,1

I must say that Jami Alden has gained a new fan.",4,1

2619594,a crooked attorney has little appeal,"I found the characters quite unlikeable, especially Teddy, a supposedly larger-than-life person who was actually very annoying.  I did finish the book because I started it, but didn't really care who committed the crimes.  The last attorney I'd ever hire if I was in a legal jam is Leo as his main strategies for dealing with tough problems center around drug and alcohol use.  Also, he shows the most appalling judgment by putting himself in dangerous situations with no means of protection or escape.  Maybe he got stoned one too many times.  Let's hope his instincts for survival become keener in any sequels that may be written.",2,0

1499077,A fun book to put a smile on your face,"This book was a lot of fun to read.  Lexi was such a fun character who at first appears to have gotten the dream transformation.  I know I always pictured myself losing two clothing sizes, having perfect teeth, a handsome husband and a career on the fast track.  But this book really makes you think if that is what is most important.  The relationship between Lexi and Eric was so dysfunctional it was funny and I was rooting for Jon the whole time.  I'm glad Lexi ended up sticking it to all the jerks at her company in the end and only wish I could have seen their reaction after they found out what Lexi achieved.  Definitely recommend this as a put a smile on your face read.",4,1

While as a reader there are places on the spiral where you lose sight of some particular action, the complex world reemerges and the story continues on. I was very happy to read the happy ending for Sasha, after worrying about her for a long time. Yes, we all get older - the goon squad of the title - but we can also get better.",4,1

6885642,The TP-LINK TL-WR741ND with DD-WRT performs better!,"I purchased the TL-WA5110G to replace an older failing wireless router that I used to connect to a wireless ISP. I also purchased a TP-LINK TL-WR741ND, and installed the latest version of DD-WRT on it. After spending an hour going back and forth between the two testing the performance, I found the WR741ND with DD-WRT performed significantly better by about 20%. With the TL-WA5110G, I would average around 4Mbps, and the WR741ND around 5Mbps consistently. Mind you nothing changed with the antenna configuration. All I did was swap back and forth the LAN cable and external antenna connection between the two when I was comparing. I don't know what would happen if I had the TL-WA5110G at both ends of the link, but contrary to the manufacturers claims, the TL-WA5110G receiver sensitivity is significantly less than that of the TL-WR741ND's.",2,0
833523,A great look at multicultural identity,"I loved this book! I enjoyed reading about the Jewish community in India as well as learning more about the Muslim, Indian, Pakistini cultures.Shepard's physical journey is one of rich backdrops and exotic Indian locales, all which Shepard paints beautifully. A particularly vivid scene of traveling by train in a world where cars are segregated by sex becomes a haunting look at what it means to be a stranger in a strange land. We ache for the mistakes Shepard makes as an American abroad.Still more exquisite is Shepard's other journey. It is one luxuriously mapped out inner voyage that asks her to question her identity and her place in the world. Her identity is itself another math problem. Before she discovers her Indian Jewish roots, she considers herself: ""Half Pakistani, half American. Half Muslim, half Christian. Half-half."" But just where does this ""half-half,"" as she calls it, belong?",5,1

6605258,You fix computers? Why don't you have this yet?!,This little device is the perfect solution for any computer tech or even a home user. If you know anything about computers and you need to get some data off of a hard drive this is the best thing. It's incredibly small and connects to the three major hard drive types. I had a client who needed their data off a dead laptop that was over 6 years old and used a weird SATA like plug called PATA. Since I only started working on laptops the last few years I thought all laptops used SATA drives. This device worked perfect.Pros- Small!- Runs old laptop and PC drives- Comes with power adapter- USB compatible with any system- Decent speed- Great for cloning- Uses 4 pin plug for power just like a PC power supply(I have not tried plugging it into power supply for power but I think it would work)Cons- Unfortunately the power adapter isn't small,5,1

She does what makes her happy and does not care what her family or anyone else thinks.She wants more than just a friend relationship with Father Michael but is quickly put off by her overachieving sister that is very jealous.To me this book is about never giving up.  Always go for your dreams, keep hoping and never allow family to stand in the way of your own happiness.  I see myself in this book.I will definitely read more by this author in the future.  Maybe a book that brings Maggie down a few pegs?Thanks for a wonderful reads.The bunnies and I give this book 4 carrots.",4,1

3274253,SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!!,"I have seen these books on the shelves and in the kindle store for years and skipped over them thinking that they would be too &#34;teen&#34; for me. I love YA books and all things vampire, but I am an adult and there is only so many high school mean girls I can take. When I saw they were making it into a movie, however, I finally decided to give it a try. I cannot say enough about how wrong I was, nor how much I LOVED it!!!First, let me say, it is SO refreshing to see a strong female character amongst the many shy, klutzy girls we've been seeing so much of lately! Second, the vampire story line itself was unique and interesting. Third, the relationship between Lissa and Rose was endearing, and finally, the forbidden love between Dimitri and Rose was perfectly frustrating enough to ensure I am going to finish the series!!This is a true testament to the statement &#34;Don't judge a book by it's cover!&#34;",5,1
8708207,False Advertising,"I actually bought this release as part of a boxed set of the original trilogy (now known as episodes 4-6), but I can't find that boxed set on Amazon so I'm writing the review for &#34;A New Hope&#34;, aka Star Wars.  I know this is old news now and there are at least a hundred other reviews here on Amazon complaining about this, but I was absolutely disgusted when I bought this set because the packaging claimed it included both the overblown, &#34;spiffed up&#34; versions of the movies and the original theatrical releases, and both were listed as being &#34;Widescreen&#34;.  I only wanted to watch the original version - I couldn't care less about Lucas' revamped version.  So I pop the DVD with the original version of the movie in my DVD player and get something on the screen that's letterboxed on all four sides and is such a tiny picture that I can't stand to watch in on my big screen TV.

When I saw that this was on blu-ray I wasn't expecting the quality to be that much different than the DVD of it, boy was I wrong! When I watched it in blu-ray it was as if I had never seen it before due to the studio restoring its colors & clarity! The colors were beautiful and you can see how truly detailed their outfits and make up are. It makes you feel like you're in the movie back in 1955, the quality of the newly restored picture is unbelievable. For those of you who have never seen White Christmas, this movie has it all, singing (of course since its 2 stars are Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney), dancing & comedy by Danny Kay & Vera Ellen, and a bunch of beautiful stage performances all mixed in with the Christmas feeling. Its great for the ENTIRE family to watch together during the holidays, a true classic!",5,1

6026890,A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK,"Dramatizing a quintessentially literary ghost story for film is not easy, in fact, it is pretty well doomed to partial failure for those who have grown up with the Henry James masterpiece in print and in several movies that have based themselves upon it.This is quite successful in showing Brittan's music to good effect. I found it interesting, entertaining, well-sung well-acted, well-directed; however, I found it much too prosaic and realistic to evoke the air of mystery, of the unknown and unknowable, that an effective ghost story should possess.I have not seen any of the other versions available on DVD, but would guess that the average viewer cannot go wrong watching this if his objective is seeing  Benjamin Brittan's opera rather than Henry Jame'sstory.",4,1

2791970,Going back to the future,"Having seen chemical fertilizer kill the soil and weaken plants, I had no trouble understanding the message in this book. We have implemented natural farming techniques in our tropical tree plantations in the Orinoco River basin of Colombia, and all I can say is that the results are exactly what this book suggests they should be - spectacular, with soil that is alive, full of micro-fauna, and with less cost to maintain, though a bit more labor intensive. If you are concerned about where chemical fertilizers and transgenic seeds are taking us, then this is the book that started the idea of going back in the future to what our ancestors already knew. I highly recommend this as an easy and interesting read for people who care about our planet and future generations.",5,1

The sets and props are all very good. The effects and CGI effects are top notch A-list level quality. Overall, this movie is impressive. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie its 0-60 from the start. The Silent Hill franchise is very impressive; the producers need to focus on quality script, and character development to industry A-list level. This franchise has a niche of its own similar to Resident evil, and they can probably produce another (3) sequels. These types of movies are special and rare, so I recommend you buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks",5,1
5193517,Not as good as expected,"I was attracted to the description of this book, but the book didn't live up to the description. I was hoping it would get better farther in the book. Unfortunately that didn't happen. The characters were dull. It was a very bland romance novel.",1,0

9122432,The Most Unique Comedy Around,"This is, unfortunately for me right now, one of those shows that you just need to see to understand. I recommend checking out some of their live stand-up/music routines on YouTube to get a taste of their humor.The show itself is  sort of a unique sitcom with comedic music videos mixed in to the story. For me, the funniest scenes are actually during the dialog scenes, and not so much the music (even though the music is hilarious). The writing is extremely clever, and the acting is even better. It's hard to sit through a scene with Jermaine, Bret and their manager Murray without laughing - the chemistry is perfect.I'm excited to see this coming out on DVD so soon and for so cheap. Flight of the Conchords made my summer, and this DVD is probably the best $20 you'll spend this year.",5,1

Following on from Her Forbidden Hero, I knew I was in for something amazing with this story. We got to learn more about Brady Scott, the older brother of Alyssa and best friend of Marco. We got to find out more about his 'daddy issues' with Joseph, which strangely left me with mixed feelings as it  changed my opinion from book one. Then my emotions and interest in this story went full pelt when he saw Joss Daniels, prepare for a full on, attention grabbing and heart warming story that had me in happy tears at the end but many a oh my God tears during, trust me! Meeting the Vieri family had a odd effect on me, I found myself thanking them via my kindle for all that they had done. This series is worthy of all 5 stars but that's only because i can't give it more on this site. Right knocking isn't working, I wonder if there is a Santa around........",5,1
5290124,Not quite sure,"After reading this book, which I made myself finish, I'm very confused.  I disliked Foster immediately.  Unfortunately I actually know someone like him.  Very intelligent, but no social skills and very arrogant. The same with Beck, smart but shallow as all get out.  I couldn't even make myself like any character in this, even her grandmother.  That's pretty bad!",1,0
2976913,Great resource for parents,"As a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, I highly recommend this book. It is straightforward and instructive without being so technique-focused that you are afraid you won't get it right.It's my experience that parents are tired of freaking out and tired of being the homework police, but they get sucked into the role night after night. It doesn't have to be this way, and this book will help you find a way out--but you'll have to do your own homework!",5,1
4689781,Good solid zombie story,When I started reading this book I wasn't sure I would get into it. I felt it was clich&eacute; and was worried it wouldn't be well written. It took me a few chapters to hook in a different start enjoying it but by the end I was satisfied. It had a few new ideas for a zombie outbreak and was set in a location that allowed the story to be realistically contained.The writing is solid and the characters are managed well.If you are looking for an enjoyable zombie read I recommend it,4,1
5282879,Sweet,"I have absolutely no idea why there are some reviews that take exception to some actions in this story. I guess everyone has an opinion and they are definitely allowed their opinions.

8010283,Good story,In my opinion this story was worth 4 stars! I enjoyed it but felt it should have gone more in depth with the  characters past and emotions especially Reagan's. It was  also pretty short and  did not have  an epilogue.,4,1

Cyn and Raphael are my favorite couple in the series and I always enjoy watching their love grow stronger.My favorite story in the volume is Vignette #9, The Wedding. Rajmund and Sarah are getting married and Cyn has planned a shopping trip with Sarah and Emma, Duncan&#8217;s mate, and a bachelorette party later in the evening. However, the girls never make it to the party because Cyn and Sarah are kidnapped from a changing room in a department store!I love the series and can&#8217;t wait to find out what the author has in store for us next!",5,1
9223104,Grows On You,"I watch a lot of British serials, and recently discovered New Tricks. While not in the category of, say, Foyles War, this is a well-acted and written series. The theme song is absolutely awful, but once you're past that you can find dependable entertainment. The series is smart and funny, and the stories are interesting. I find myself caring about the characters and wanting to know more about them. That's how I know I'm hooked on a series. Do't make your judgement based on just one show -- watch a few and you'll find the series growing on you.",4,1
1435238,"History, Economics, and Mystery","David Liss has real writing talent as well as serious knowledge of his subject. Story takes place in early 18th century England and at its heart is about the difference between paper assets and real assets, a lesson long forgotten in our paper money society. There are murder mysteries, complex plots, a little romance, and religion. It has got it all and won the Edgar for best first novel. I would read The Coffee Trader first because it takes place BEFORE this which is unusual.",5,1

Reheat is quicker of course if your not coming from cold start.  The fact the kettle comes off the base is sen better because your not attached to a cord trying to poor hot water.  Like I said the price is great, it has a pretty large capacity for its price point. It is quicker than a tea kettle on the stove I will say that much! The outside gets warm but not so hot you cannot touch it! An indicator light would be nice, but I am sure that would jack the price up!",4,1
5566040,Firehouse Six,I really enjoy this series. I've been waiting for Michael and Simon to get together. The tension in the previous books between them was great.It was sad that something bad had to happen to bring them together. But I enjoyed how they worked out their differences.,5,1

Disappointed the sequel wasn't waiting for me to purchase. Glad to recommend this book.",5,1
1970060,One Plus One by Jojo Moyes,"Jojo Moyes is two for two in my experience with her novels. I loved Me Before You and now I can add One Plus One to the &#8220;loved&#8221; category. Through the entire book I wanted to hug Jess, her stepson Nicky and daughter Tanzie and tell them &#8220;hang in there. It&#8217;ll be ok&#8221;.  I felt the same way for a few characters in Me Before You. Moyes never makes her characters pathetic or maudlin &#8211; just truly human. And while she does that she writes incredibly funny scenes as well as heartbreaking ones. The car trip to the Math Olympiad had me laughing out loud most of the time. Ultimately the point is made that everyone deserves a second chance &#8211; and to never give up. I turned the final page with a satisfied smile hoping that Jojo Moyes&#8217; next book won&#8217;t be too far away. I&#8217;m a fan. Highly recommended.*I received a review copy in exchange for my opinion*",5,1
4172804,my high school students appreciate it!,Ordered many copies for my students (who reimbursed me) -- makes Romeo and Juliet more accessible -- students don't have to stop reading to look up words or phrases --- can view &#34;one page original and one page modern version&#34; at same time.  Allows students to focus more on the actual story than the &#34;outdated&#34; language.,5,1
2323255,Even Tabitha didn't like it,"I thought about giving this two stars, but it's a Stephen King book, so against all his others I have to give it one only.  The first part of the book was so hard to get through because it was so dull.  It did pick up a bit, but I still had to force my way through.  It wasn't scary, the characters were not interesting and the pacing was off.  It wasn't just that it took parts from other books, they were washed down.  Compare the kids in It to these.  Compare the aliens in Tommyknockers to these.  Compare the villain from Golden Years to these.  The book just doesn't hold up.  I only finished it so I could start Black House with a clear conscience.  I wasn't surprised at the end to find that his wife hadn't like the book, either.  Should have listened to her, Steve, and left his one in the trunk.",1,0

She's a strong mother and one to be admired for where she is now.",5,1
8441684,Thought provoking reading,"Although this book is not my usual kind of reading, I was curious about the chosen subjects after watching a programme on something similar. The author presents the information in a way that's thought provoking, with statements such as &#34;Falling in love with life is the ultimate expression of gratitude&#34;. The chapters lead naturally from concept to concept, and whilst I couldn't directly relate to all the concepts, there were chapters such as 'What Is The Ego', which really engaged me, and I'm now curious to find out more. Definitely recommended reading for anyone who's interested in finding out more about the imagination and hypnosis, and their relationships to psychic senses.",5,1

Wise makes the science of fear fascinating, and he writes about it here in a gripping, fun and engaging way for all readers. I was drawn into the book by the compelling anecdotes the author relates, and enterprising information on the brain he provides. Now I'm even a little scared of how my mind works... But EXTREME FEAR is a thrilling read, and something anyone who's ever been in a frightening situation will be able to relate to.",5,1

The downside is that most people didn't know about the app, so they thought I was kidding and continued to try and text me.

It just so happens they really need us too.  Relic is more than a love story between Raphael and Serena.  It's about three souls bound by an ancient relic and a love that lives forever.  The ride they (Raphael and Serena) take together is phenomenal.Deena is a Indie writer that I consider my new must read author.",5,1

3022663,Interactive Four-Week Plan for Your Finances,"Derek Olsen has written an engaging, interactive four-week plan to take control of your finances and reduce/eliminate debt. There are a lot of tools in the book, including budget and savings worksheets. As Derek explains, the goal of his book is not to create a perfect budget, but to create healthy spending habits.

1279900,Not Hard Hitting Sci-Fi but Entertaining,"In A Case of Conscience, James Blish lays out an interesting set of ideas however its quite obvious that his concerns are from a different time - a time of Cold War fears and nuclear terror.  However, the story he writes is a compelling one.  While these topics - what happens to an alien race when humans want their planet for something else, the desire for other sources of resources, man's incredibly strong penchant for killing themselves - have all been dealt with in countless science fiction books and television shows, Blish eloquently deals with these subjects using four unique characters and four unique points of view.  Possibly falling into the category of a modern parable, A Case of Conscience remains an interesting and provocative novel.It's a light book but fulfilling and a genuinely good read.",4,1
2273253,Everything you ever wanted to know about L. Ron Hubbard but were afraid to ask,"Having read many of the Scientology-damning books published in the last 20 years or so--Lawrence Wright, Jenna Miscavige Hill, Janet Reitman, Jon Atack, Mark Headley, John Sweeney and more--I can say unequivocally that Russell Miller's &#34;Bare-Faced Messiah&#34; is the Holy Grail when it comes to stripping away the myth of founder L. Ron Hubbard.If you are at all acquainted with Hubbard's story, many of the incidents related here will be familiar to you. But you will learn bizarre--sometimes touching--details that you've never read or heard before.In short, this is investigative journalism at its finest. Well-written, well-documented and packed with information, this biography tears the lid off the shiny stories about Hubbard's &#34;incredible&#34; life and achievements. They are incredible, all right, but not for the reasons Scientologists would have you believe.",5,1

The wonderful thing about reading this latest novel is not found only in the dynamic plot and characters but in witnessing Finder grow as a writer with each new book.The Nick Heller character is one of my favorites. So glad to see Heller develop into more... and for those of you not on Finder's twitter feed, you'll find it's very creative and fun with each new novel. Keeping Up With Joe Finder is much MUCH more interesting than keeping up with anyone else (ahem).Keep writing, Joe, and I'll keep buying. Congratulations on this one. It's fabulous.",5,1
660305,Exciting fiction intertwined with events just prior to WWII,"Overall, an interesting and well written exploit based upon two fictional characters, one American and one British, both derived from the cold facts surrounding the Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin. I found the book entertaining enough to keep me reading during a 4 hour airline flight. The characters are well fleshed out, believable, and you'll find yourself wondering whether the story is plausible as a reasonable explanation for several events that we all know took place. That, obviously, is not the author's intent, but it's a legitimate thought. You'll have to decide for yourself.",4,1
7614453,Toasty in my new house and 25 degrees outside with furnace pilot out,"My first review of any product.  I needed a space heater for my office since I work at home and did not want to crank up the furnace, so I ordered from Amazon based on previous reviews and am delighted.  Because I am in a new house unpacking and trying to work I just did not get around to having the furnace man come out and show me the ropes.  I don't even know where the furnace is located yet, and I tried to set the thermostat, hoping the pilot was lit, and it never came on. The forecast was for low of 32, but it actually got down to 25, and the thing kept me toasty, the office about 69 degrees.  Outstanding.  It made one creak on the maiden voyage and smelled slighty oily once.  I may order one for the living room, too.  I was used to the ""milkhouse"" style heater and but had burned my leg severely with one and wanted to try something new.  Highly recommended.",5,1
8959874,Annoying!,"Since so many people have written what this movie is about, so I won't go into it.  While I was watching this movie, I became very annoyed with that blond female.  It seems like only roll in this film and that Devil's Reject movie (I think it's the same girl) is for her to just shake her bottom.  She certainly cannot dance very well!  She really annoyed me, so I was hoping that somehow she'll be just gone from that movie later on, but that didn't happen.  Why can't Rob Zombie make a movie with decent actors and actresses who knows how to act?!  Why can't he make a movie that aren't always degrading women?!  If that blond is the one he is married to, then who  is that dark hair girl with the braid in his video?  Anyways, if you want to see a good horror film with good acting, well this isn't it!",1,0

8891122,Great movie.,"Yet another one of the few movies that I consider worthy of re-watching. Though this is my favourite genre (hell, I even liked Waterworld), this movie was very well done. It's extremely dark and forboding. The atmosphere is incredibly good. Sure, it's not entirely realistic (I can't think of a virus that would hit you in 10 seconds and turn you freaky so fast), but details like that aside I consider this to be a pretty accurate depiction of how a catastrophe like this could hit the world.Certain scenes are, of course, very memorable. Two in particular would be: 1) When what's-his-face wakes up and wanders around London, and nobody is around and 2) When what's-his-face et al. find a man and his daughter holed up, waiting everything out.Movies like this make one think ""Damn, that could be me one day."" Will it be you? Almost certainly not, but this is fiction with a real possibility to it, and that's what makes it so visceral and real.",5,1

6818356,Great Option For Those Who Hate Active Noise Cancelling,For the most part these are a slighty updated version of theBose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphoneswithout the Active Noise Cancelling. They have a quality build as do all bose headphones and comfort is superior. The sound is what you would expect from Bose and have amazing sound and Noise Cancellation for Non-Active headphones. I did have an issue where a speaker was having a problem making a connection with the magnet but using my skills in electronic repair I fixed it myself. They work fine now. After 3 years of pretty heavy usage the leather on the outside of the memory foam headphones is beginning to peel off as I would expect after being exposed to oil from skin for long periods of time. They cost a nice chunk of change to replace but are not completely uncomfortable without the leather. I recommend if you want to own a Bose Product and don't want to dish out a weeks pay on it,5,1

We Five - yes. Also - where - oh God where is the 1966 Jefferson Airplane?  Folk Rock (and yes, I was there folks) was 1965 to EARLY 1967 before psychedelia. After Disc 1, there was NO FOLK ROCK LEFT.  The influence was there to a degree, but that was it. It began January 1965 and was gone as of June 1967.

1421852,An Introduction to Modern Literature via Symbolism,"_Axel's Castle_ provides a wonderful introduction to modern literature and its sources in the Symbolist movement. However, the book is a bit uneven, and some writers garner more attention than others; Stein gets only about ten pages. It is clear that Wilson views Joyce and Proust as the two most significant modern writers, and those two chapters are accordingly the most insightful of the book and worth the price of the entire volume. In addition, the book will introduce most readers to the deservedly obscure Villiers de L'Isle Adam and may impel them to read _Axel_. Perhaps the latter volume will someday return to print now that Wilson's first work of literary criticism has finally done so. If you are at all interested in any of these authors or the Symbolist movement, this book is essential as Wilson is one of the foremost literary critics of the century, and this is perhaps his most representative and greatest work.",4,1

To me it seemed like any other bride taking her time, not really looking to get married book. But as I read on, I was thoroughly enchanted by the story. I loved the history the book presented and the characters were so very real. I identified with each of them, and felt genuine emotion for each of the characters. I particularly LOVED Emily's story.

I'm thinking of buying an amplifier maybe that way the signal can go through at the same strength it did when I was using a shorter cable that had to dangle around loosely with people always running into it.I mean for the amount of cable you get the signal loss isn't even bad, but the fact that there was signal loss made me not give this a 5. I heard that you can get cables this long without any signal loss but they are extremely expensive so I just stuck to this and tried my luck!",4,1

9158877,Good workout but be careful!,"This is a great DVD but unfortunately, i couldn't finished the 30 days because i injured both of my shoulders. I used 5 and 8 pounds weights. If you are not used to working out with weights, start off with 2 pounds and move up. I plan to try it again, with 2 pound weights. I finished physical therapy on both of my shoulders 6 months ago and i am finally feeling stronge enough to use weights again... Good luck!",4,1
4168018,Worth It!,"I'm glad I ignored the one negative review.  I could not put this book down.  The book seemed to address in a very realistic way, the roller coaster emotions that Rett and Tracey had to deal with as they fell in love.  The setting was in the deep south and delved into the very different backgrounds of Garrett, an all American middle class white law student and Tracey, a well to do African American grad student.  Somehow opposites attract but the two have to figure out a way to exist in the outside world.  The author developed the characters well, showed the evolution of the relationship and ultimately we got the happy ending that you expect from a romance novel.  This was my first book by this author, but I'll be looking for others.  Well done!",4,1
441512,"Great movie, good book","If you've seen and loved the movie you'll love the book.  Virginia, Tony, Wolf, and Prince, fight to save the 9 Kingdoms from the Queen, the trolls, and the Huntsman just like in the movie.  The book's plot is much the same, with the main characters visiting the kingdoms and meeting characters from  fairy tailes such as: Snow White, Cinderella, Jack 'n' the Beanstalk, etc.  There are slight differences between the book and movie in the plot, but  that, in my point of view, only makes it better.  The book also clears up a  few question left over from the movie, and gives you a better point of view  to understand why everything is happening.",4,1
3600375,Great Read,I really enjoyed this series..I do recommend this book if you are into Paranormal Romance.. It has some editing issues but not enough to make me not finish reading..I really enjoyed the story line..Can not wait for the next one.,5,1

949461,the truth hurts,I found this book very hard to read...the writing was superb. However the content was thought provoking and very racist. The book spelled out every detail about the racist practices of the french and other whites at that time. The book is a reference for history persons. I will refer to the book for its historical and racial content. I found it very hard to accept the attitudes of that time period because it is reminicent of the present day attitude towards africanss.,4,1
9154669,The End begins,"Happy 20th anniversary of Power Rangers everyone, I am a 28 year old man who is still a loyal fan of Power Rangers for 20 years since Power Rangers come in air in 1993. MMPR Season 3 is one of my favorite Power Rangers seasons included In Space, Lost Galaxy, Wild Force, Time Force, Operation Overdrive, RPM and my #1 favorite is Lightspeed Rescue. This season had many memories like the debut of their ninja powers and new badass zords like the awesome Shogun Megazord, a new ally named Ninjor, also sad memories like the destruction of the Thunderzords and the end of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers season will begin. This season, the Power Rangers had new enemies like the dangerous, ruthless, and cunning Master Vile and his ugly and disgusting Gloober monster who defeated Ninjor easily. As a fan of Power Rangers, I want you my loyal Power Rangers fans to buy all of the Power Rangers seasons 1-20.",5,1
8893868,Best Comic Move EVER!,I thought the first Spider-Man movie was a thrill. This one was 100x better!!! I really thought the trailers would have spoiled the whole movie because they showed way too much but there are scenes they don't show that just blow you away! Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite Spidey villain and he's perfect here! Tobey Maguire really comes to life as Peter Parker in this film. I love the facial expressions he has when things aren't going well for Peter. The story leaves room for at least two more movies and the hints at upcoming villains are enough to ensure that the Spidey series will only get better and better!,5,1
8200547,Excellent!!,I love the way the writer pulled me into this story. I felt like I connected with the characters and felt the emotions they felt.

5836631,Well....Okay!,"When I purchased this CD, I was not too impressed initially.  I expected that blaring R&amp;B sound that Mint has traditionally produced in the previous releases.  However, after listening to this CD a few times, it  really is an incredible piece.  Stokley's vocals are still crisp and clean,  it's just that he doesn't need to &quot;blare&quot; anymore.  Mint has  taken a different approach in Aquarium, they have demonstrated a true  ability to produce a nice R&amp;B GROOVE.  Be Like That Sometimes, Pretty  Lady (Charlie Wilson) are two cuts that I would love to have been in the  studio watching them record.  Their skills and talents as musicians still  shine through...it's just a little slower groove.",4,1

Taron has probably did something big that can mess up everyone's life! I really really hope he did not do that though because if he did that's a WTH moment.

I didn't know that, and now I'm just hugely disappointed. What I thought was a neat way to make me look forward to the next book was really just a cliffhanger that left so many issues unresolved ESPECIALLY after the *spoiler alert* bastard fox comes out and says that while the true Storm Kings heir is dead, they may still end up trying to kill Isaac because they think the prophesy will be passed down.I hope Mrs. Reed comes to her senses and adds an extra novel or at least a novella to finish this off on a better note.",2,0

2674461,Just one paragraph makes the whole book worthwhile.,"One of this book's themes is that things which we may consider bad have environments in which they are exactly what we need, i.e. the perfect good, and that there is an alternative name for these personality characteristics usually which conveys that ""silver lining"" aspect.The example I love, because of experience with cherished friends that way, is PARANOID. The alternative word is hypervigilant, and the application obviously, and it happened in this persons life a lot, is that they would make a great security guard and job / renter interviewer perhaps also. Of course, they are hard hard hard to get to know with all of that secrecy tendency which goes along with it, but they can with goodwill and luck become very good friends in some circumstances. It is a shame that it takes so much longer to get to know them than some other people, at least for me it did. But it was worth it in the final outcome.",5,1

Types of plants and flowers the soil types, silt, loam, and what the actually is. Explains the amount of sun or shade suggested for different plantings. What could be hazardous to a pet if eaten, or a small child, good to know! What you'd want your garden to convey, what it says of you.  Container gardening. What are plant stressors. What is wrong with your plants if you notice, black leaves mold, etc  And it tells a wonderful story of groups doing differents types of plantings in spacific reas. The book is just great.

5779614,Alex Reece &#8206;- So Far,"Alex Reece, the vanguard of jazzstep (when such distinctions actually meant something), only released one major label album, SO FAR, but what an album it is. ""Feel the Sunshine,"" dives head first into the funky bassline, with Deborah Anderson's sultry vocals floating above, and ""Out of Time"" similarly emphasizes the thick double-bass. ""Acid Lab,"" on the other hand, puts more of a tech spin on things, and ""Pulp Friction,"" in particular, has a growling bass to accompany the horn flourishes, but it's certainly the darkest track here. But fear not: the R&B tinged ""Candles"" brings the mood back up with ease, and ""Ibiza"" brings the summer right into your home. But, for me, the best track is still ""Jazz Msater,"" a buoyant track that starts with a languorous horn fanfare before the good feeling kicks in full-time. The keyboard is exceptionally perky, and the whole thing is toe-tapping fun. It's a pity Alex Reece didn't go further.",5,1
449138,"Flawed, but well worth the read","If I graded this book, it would be an A for ideas and a C for execution. Paper-thin characters, abrupt and unsatisfying ending, cliches galore, etc. But the ideas are so good and the science reasonable enough to not bother a scientist reader that this is still a good read. Hopefully the author didn't use up all his ideas on this book and can develop better plot skills for future books. I suppose my main problem with the book is it could have been a classic instead of just pretty good. Maybe someday the author will revise it.",4,1

The controls are well laid out and the physical Start button is a nice touch as compared to the rest of the buttons which are flabby membrane switches. Setting power is not as convenient with some units as you must press to subtract power in 10% increments from 100. Thus, getting to 30% takes 7 pushes. I seem to be getting less overflow on heating so it suggests the power application is smoother than the 8 yo Panasonic we replaced. Door is fine, door opening switch is fine.

Partly because of the relaxed happy style in which it was produced, and partly because of the range of practices available.

8620739,My favorite movie,"Back in the day when the cops were dirty, the women were dames, and the music was jazz; LA Confidential delivers a perfect portrayl of Los Angles during the early 1950s.  This is a brilliantly crafted crime drama based on James Ellroy's novel.  The characters and the places appear to be so real that you wonder if this really happened (it didn't).  Kim Basinger won the Oscar for her role as the ""high classed whore cut to look like Veronica Lake"".  Guy Pearce truly shines as an up and coming police detective.  Its amazing that this guy isn't a $20 mil/picture star.  With enough twists and turns to keep anyone enthralled, give this a look...in fact don't look, buy it.  You will watch it again and again.",5,1

The cons: The zippers do not seem real sturdy, and I'm not sure they will last as long as the rest of the bag will.

Many of them indicated that the unit worked great the first day or so, but then simply stopped working.  So when I took mine to work and began using it at my desk, I waited for the inevitable failure of my speaker.  And I waited.  And I waited some more.  Yet still it persists!I'd held off on my review for that very reason, but now that I've gone a solid 2 weeks of consistent use, I can safely say that the Creative D200 is a great device.  It syncs effortlessly with my iPhone 4 and provides clear, deep sound.  While I'm not cranking it up to full volume at my desk, I did test it at relatively loud volume before I took it to work, and it sounded great then.  The high and lows are clear and efficient; while it isn't a Klipsch or Bose system, the sound quality is great for what I need.I really enjoy the system and wholeheartedly recommend it!",5,1

4574218,Very unique pasta cookbook,"Our whole family loves pasta, but especially my son-in-law.  So when Pasta Revolution came my way, I started seeking new recipes for our Sunday family dinners.  This book affords a wide range of options and interesting combinations.  Although we live in a very rural area, it would be worth a trip to a larger city to acquire the needed ingredients to make something new and exciting.  There is certainly a wide range of choices in this book.",4,1
7625156,"It huffs, and puffs, and... well, you know the rest!","This is a thin, tall squirrel fan.  It moves a lot of air, is quiet, and can be set to oscillate (moves back and forth).The remote is very handy.  I have mine set up over in the corner of the room and I put the remote on my desk when I'm using it.  When I'm not, it stores neatly on top of the fan and clicks into place so it won't fall off and get lost.I use it to get some of the hot air that my computer generates out of the room.  It works very well.Looks nice too!  The black with chrome accents is very stylish while blending into the overall room.",4,1
2207766,When I'm 164...,"Expanded from a short story published 17 years earlier, Methuselah's Children is about a subset of the human race (the Howard Families) who are exceptionally long-lived due to selective interbreeding. When the rest of humanity turns on them, mistakenly believing they are holding back some secret of longevity, they hijack a starship and go in search of a new home. This journey eventually leads them to a couple of planets with indigenous inhabitants that end up posing different sorts of threats that allow author Robert Heinlein to make a few points about liberty and the nature of Man.I enjoyed the story for the most part though the alien civilizations were rather underwhelming. Frankly, I'd rather have seen the Howard Families either duke it out with earth's administrators or find an uninhabited planet they have to colonize, which would generate conflicts and disagreements that would make interesting reading. Nevertheless, a fairly enjoyable read.",4,1
3627144,Held my interest from beginning to end.,"Mrs. Poe is exactly the reason why I enjoy historical fiction.  I learn about people and places and am entertained at the same time.  Does it bother me that I don't really know where fact stops and fiction begins?  Not really.I had no idea that Poe led such a tragic life.  I didn't know that he married his young cousin, that she was ill and died young, and that he was in love with a woman named Frances Osgood.This story immerses you into the life and style of the 1800's.  How concerned people were with scandals, while at the same time, doing scandalous things.  I can't help thinking about how similar the behavior is to today's behaviors, yet had these people lived now, how different the ending would have been.  Poe could easily divorce his wife and marry (or not) Frances Osgood.  He was a celebrity at the time, and we hardly even blink an eye at divorce and unrequited love affairs of celebrities.This book held my interest from beginning to end with even a bit of a mystery thrown in.  &#65279;",4,1

Interesting read about how a great pitcher is made.",5,1
8587552,Good but Lacking,"If your looking for a realistic western than this is the best you can do. No epic bloodshed(as with spaghetti westerns)and no overly macho heroes(typical american westerns). This film is about and is based on a true story and its one of the only movies I know of that doesnt take its &quot;artistic license&quot; too far. This movie keeps its realistic edge while still managing to entertain. That being said, its also a sad movie that leaves you with an empty used feeling at the end. Watching a movie and feeling worse than you did when starting it is in my opinion the mark of a film that has too much of a downward slope. Anyways do not highly reccomend to anybody unless they want a realistic movie that will make you feel sad and used.",4,1

6678688,Cable has noisy audio,"I'm using this with a Sony Vaio VGC-RC210G deskside ""media center"" computer, and a SyncMaster 940mw monitor with built-in speakers.I was using a separate DVI cable & audio cable. The original audio cable that came with the Sony was totally 100% quiet (no hum/noise).  The original audio cable had big ferrite(?) filters at each end.With this new cable, I would have been able to reduce from 2 cables to 1 cable (since it has both video & audio in 1 cable).  But when I attached the new audio cable it has hum/noise that's very audible when I turn the monitor's speakers up past 70%.  What a crappy new cable!So, yeah, I'll probably just end up throwing away the new cable, and going back to using the 2 separate cables I already had.",2,0

7763055,"Great towels, especially for the price","I stay in good to nice hotels all the time, and these towels exceed all them.  They are very soft, heavy, and dry you off almost instantaneously.  We have only washed them a couple times, but they have held up well and haven't bled any.  I really love these towels.  My wife's only complaint is that the towels aren't big enough (i.e. bath sheet size), but if the usual hotel size towel is OK for you as it is for me, then the larger ones included is not a good buy, but an excellent buy.  5/5 stars easily earned with plenty of room, and that's not even considering the extremely reasonable price.

Enter one drop dead gorgeous hunk called Luca.  Luca was well known for having numerous affairs with women, and leaving them behind.  Adriana thought that perfect, no strings, no long term commitments or relationship.But things don&#8217;t always go as planned.An aria is defined as a piece of music for one voice, or occasionally two voices in an opera.  Arias are melodious and usually elaborate.  The title could not be more spot.  For a ballerina and a designer, elaborate is the perfect adjective.  The relationship and story will draw you in.

1508326,disappointing,"I was very excited to finally read this book but found myself very disppointed after the first chapter. I did like Conroy's descriptions of Charleston but his dialogue and characters were completely unbelievable.His main character appeared to have no faults. He always seemed to find the good in others, was at his friends beckon call and allowed others to insult him and generally be very mean to him including his own mother without any defense on his part.It seemed to me that everyone was constantly insulting everyone else and they all seemed to have come back lines which were just as insulting. And yet everyone was still friends and ready to run to San Francisco with no thoughts about jobs, kids responsibilities etc. I would also like to mention how stereotyped his characters were, the kind black people, the whorish actress, the snooty rich guy etc.The plot and characters were simply to hard to beleive and identify with.",1,0

2390022,Helps to Put Things Into Perspective,"If you are living with a narcissist, you will recognize them in these pages. The case histories and descriptions are illustrative. At times the &#34;psychology-speak&#34; can be confusing to the lay person. Narcissits can leave you feeling crazy, confused, alone, depressed and afraid. The problem is you keep thinking there is something you can do about it which keeps you hanging in there, but it is all about them, not about what you give them, unless it is constant praise and affirmation in everything they do then over time, that may not work because they get bored with you. It is exhausting and depleting. I lived with one for 36 years and he left me to live with his new &#34;narcissistic supply&#34;. I could not understand why I could not get close to my husband but they play this &#34;come here, go away&#34; game that you cannot win.

Fortunately, I have a monthly membership with BB and I had already checked out enough DVDs to break even, because I finally turned off this tiresome and pretentious piece of rubbish about 20 minutes from the end. I must confess that I had the English subtitles on and was often fast-forwarding at 2x through many scenes and simply reading what was being said. It was that bad. I could not decide if this movie was a parody of what we THINK  life was like back in those decadent, bawdy days or if it was a parody of bad movie. I am no puritan. It wasn't the  language or the sex. It was empty, boring, and silly. A waste of my time. AVOID!",1,0
2088172,One of the best books I ever read,"I've read a lot of books about the Templers.  This is probably the best book I ever read.  It takes you through the life of William who was a monk who became a Templar and his brother Richard, who also became a Templar.  It takes you on William's journey to find his uncle, John, and the peace that he found, it takes you on his conflict with his personal belief that killing is wrong, but as a Templar he must kill and it takes you on his journey to becoming the lead Templar knowing that many of his fellow Templar's would die.  It is so rich in historical detail that I couldn't put it down.  It's not like any other Templar book you've ever read.  I recommend this book so highly and I know that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.  If you are into the Templar lore please look into this book.  It was fantastic.",5,1

Faster and more reliable.I've had the other 2 running for a year or so with 0 reboots I think.Wireless is great for lugging your laptop around but if you have a stationary networked machine that you use for any heaving lifting (gaming.. home server.. NAS. HTPC/HD video streaming) and you can't easily get to it with Cat5/6 then this is BY FAR the way to go. I max out at about 11 or 12 MB/seconds with these adapters. As compared to 4 or so on wireless N.Literally, plug and play.

1896560,The Real Deal,"This writer is capable of anything, as she proves after entering the lion's den with Hunter S. Thompson and coming out alive and intact and full of strange & savage stories. Thompson, an antic and important voice, can't be captured by a conventional biography; but E. Jean Carroll, a brilliant and skewed stylist, is creative and resourceful. She understands the artist, and the man, and slyly gets at the essence of both. Total fun! I dare Johnny Depp to option this!",5,1
6495973,"Spacious, well-padded & looks pro","Used it for Nikon D60. It is very well-padded and provides great protection to the expensive camera and lenses inside. The space inside is enough for a large pro camera, 2 lenses, flash, and accessories. there are plenty of pockets to keep charger, cables, cards, lens-cleaning pen, filters etc. One accessory pocket is covered under the flap and one is on the side, for faster access to change cards while shooting. The pictures posted here were very helpful for me to decide to go for this bag.The yellow color interiors makes it convenient to search for the stuff and provides good looks. In terms of size, as the name says, it is large and more suitable for pro DSLR. However, I also keep aSony DCR-DVD108 DVD Handycam Camcorder with 40x Optical Zoomand aOlympus C765 4MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoomwith me while going out for photography.

Even when the book was finished, I didn&#8217;t want to say goodbye to people I had grown to love.  The underlying Christian themes of trust were powerful in a very subtle way.  Great read and I will be recommending it to many of my friends.I was given this book for free from BookClubNetwork and the publisher in exchange for my honest review.",5,1

There were a few typos, specifically areas where it seemed like the author changed the phrase and missed changing a word tense. I can overlook that her. The tone of this book comes across as the author giving advice. The informality of the book and the thought that this isn't a primary work for the author makes me more forgiving for some reason.",4,1

2047652,Not another dog story,"Although Odd Thomas is not my favorite Koontz character, as least it's not another of his dog novels, which probably lost the author many of his readers.  Still, it's one of the better Odd Thomas novels.  Probably deserves four stars on plot.  The other is for his coupling of reality with humor.  For example, the title character is trying to get away from pursuing monsters in a Chevy Volt when the battery dies.  I laughed out loud.  The politically correct will not like his references, but the common sense folks will guffaw.  Keep up the good work.",5,1

There are a lot of things that you finally learn about ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" - you know, he's named that because you can't really hope to spell it correctly without doing a google search. Finally we get a closer look into the man who became the menace. We also get to know Dumbledor better as well. More character development and maturation occurs here than in many of the other books. I really enjoyed it, and wish it hadn't stopped...I think that's really my only complaint - that I have to wait another 2 years to find out how this one really ends.",5,1

2008258,Nice tie-in to the movie,"This book is a nice tie-in to the first movie based on The Hobbit. A few points I would note after going through the book:1. This book is mostly about the movie still images and not so much about the written content. The images themselves are very nice, but be aware of the size of the book (about 11"" X 9""). This is not a coffee table book, but the images are presented nicely for the size allotted.2. The content focuses on information about the characters and places of the movie. This is not a ""behind the scenes"", or ""making of"" kind of book.3. For me, the star of this whole package is the included fold-out map. It is done in the art style originated by J.R.R Tolkien, and continued throughout the Lord of the Rings movie.4. The enjoyment I got out of this was getting a peek of how the movies will be adapting the characters and places from the book. If you're anticipating the movie as much as I am, it's a great little printed preview.",4,1
686958,Beautiful Novel,"This is a lush novel that captures the reader's senses, and it is the senses that matter in this lovely read.  Although one's sense of smell is at the forefront of the story, all of one's senses are engaged.  The reader wonders how much of the story is actually true as it blends fact with fiction in a seamless manner.  One will never look at scent in the same way again....and, a woman will gain an absolute understanding of the importance of any perfume she chooses to wear.  Outstanding!",5,1
3636957,must read,Brynne and Ethan own my heart. This book brings you 'all in'....its very emotional. There's the amazing love story that we got in the first two books plus there's heartbreak and loss and uncertainty and fear! It's worth every single second......I'm not sure if there's going to be a 4th book but I certainly hope there is! Raine Miller is an amazing author and I can't wait to read anything else she writes! 5 stars are not nearly enough for this beautiful novel!!!,5,1
3448439,Sci-Fi Meets Detective Story - It's Good,"Sam Dane arrives at a planet to assist the local police in apprehending a serial killer, which won't be easy because an annual festival is taking place and damn near everyone is drunk and looks suspicious. Sam is also hindered by his inability to speak the language or read the faces of potential suspects. As the murders continue and Sam gets closer to the killer, will he get too close? A mixture if Sci-Fi and old fashioned detective work come together in a story that is an enjoyable read. In The Blood won't blow your socks off, but it will keep you engaged in the storyline and give you a front row seat to a different world from our own. In the Blood is a good book that I can recommend for anyone interested in the genre.",4,1

2700258,Really bad,"Really bad, considering that the author is a professor of creative writing. Once more: disjointed, boring Facebook entries - not a memoir! I hope she tells her students, Do what I say, not what I do.Too bad, because she is an interesting person and probably a good writer, and I would love to read her real memoir some day.",1,0

2860316,A Good Mystery,"This year has seen a number of good novelistic treatments of the implications of the loss of privacy in the age of technology. John Hampel has created a good crime drama about a bank that tries to take over the world. The characters are well crafted and plot twists abound. Like me, Hampel spent decades working in IT. He draws great portraits of the eccentrics and occasional sociopaths that field tends to attract.A good read.",5,1
4592697,Riveting Read!,"FIVE STARS for this excellent novel! The characters were multi-dimensional and complex; the plot mixed with fiction and history. I didn't want to put the book down.

1743112,Another MacKeltar!,"This fifth book in the Highlander series was another WAW for me.I already liked Dageus in the previous book so I was glad to see this book was a story about him.I loved the fact that we saw a bit more of Silvan, Nell, Drustan and Gwen in this book cause I really loved them in the previous book.Chloe, the slightly nerdy wee lass, was fab. She was everything Dageus needed to get him through his curse. Oh, and Dageus himself... what's not to like.Although I have to say, now that I read the books about both MacKeltar twins, I have a very slight preference for Drustan (and Gwenn!).",5,1
2345163,It gets better towards the end,"The writing feels clunky and amateurish for the first half of the book, but gains momentum and heart towards the end.

7655641,My new go to tool!,"Great masher and not just for potatoes.  Makes a speedy guacamole. Great for breaking up ground meat in the pan. I also use it for mashing bananas for banana bread. The longer I have it, the more uses I find for it!  Small but powerful. Does the job of the bigger guys! Easy to store since it doesn't take up much space.I've been using this several months now and love it even more! I find I am using it far more frequently than I thought. It mashes so effortlessly.  I tested it by mashing an avocado with a fork and then with this tool. The tool did the job in a fraction of the time:)",5,1

8949560,Femme-fatale Famke...,"...was the reason I rented this, &amp; in that leather outfit she looks almost like her Jean Grey character in the X-men movies (the character in which I know her best). This movie also was my introduction to Owen Wilson, &amp; I love that scene in which he seduces Famke by singing a song by Marvin Gaye (one of my favorite singers!), with Eddie Murphy tele-coaching him. I also enjoyed the DVD commentary, in which the director &amp; a few other people comment on how this movie parodizes the Bond films by &quot;humanizing&quot; the protagonists, writing mistakes into their behavior. A few times here &amp; there, they even stumble over pronouncing the Dutch beauty's name--&quot;Fam-keh?&quot; No! &quot;Fahm-kee?&quot; No! &quot;Fahm-keh?&quot; Right on target! (No pun intended) Anyway, if there's one reason anyone oughta see this, she is it!",4,1

The picture quality, brightness and HD quality are all amazing. Amazon did a great job delivering my order on time. I have had different monitors over many years from different manufacturers, but I must say that in comparison to others, this monitor has got to be on top of the list. Given the price and quality, I would definitely recommend it. Happy shopping!",5,1
5506,Best Money Manager App for Android,"I've been using this app for over a year now and think it's still be best money manager on Android. Devs do a great job of listening to users and adding/fixing features. Ten dollars is the most I've ever paid for an app but I consider it money well spent.Edit: I see this is the FAOTD today. Guess that means all the crazies are gonna come out to trash the rating for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual app. It's a shame, really, since this is a terrific app that does what it says and does it well. I'm still using it a year and a half later... not many other apps I can say that about, if any!",5,1

6701532,Probably the best value for any processor at this point in time...,"I spent several days researching the differences between all the current Intel processors before finally deciding on this one.  The problem is that most of them are very close in price so it's difficult to make a decision on price alone.  I found that when you consider all the factors like number of cores, mhz, cache and price, this is the best option.  It is fast enough for the most demanding multimedia and games and has all the energy saving features so you won't waste energy while doing something like typing word documents.  If you are building strictly for gaming then you should probably spend the extra $30 on the Q9550 even though this one will do quite well if paired with a high end graphics card.  On the other hand, if you are building as a office type computer for email and word processing etc, you should probably save the $20 and go with the E8400.  This one is the perfect middle ground for great performance at a great price!",5,1

8643094,A truly epic battle...,"A very powerful film, realistic and gritty, it tells the story of Operation Market Garden when the Allied forces try to knock the Third Reich out of the war with one blow.  The idea is simple - grab a bunch of bridges in Holland, using airborne units, which would then be linked up by a massive ground assult.  The result would be a pathway right into the heartland of Germany, straight into their factories and workshops.  The real result was more casualties for the Allies than suffered during the D-Day invasion.It is a great movie, full of drama, humor, and movie stars.  Gene Hackman, James Caan, Sean Connery, Robert Redford, and Michael Caine to name a few.  It was based on the book, A Bridge Too Far, but I am not sure how authentic it is to the facts.  But it is a must see, right up there with such films asTora! Tora! Tora! (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Patton (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), andThe Longest Day (Two-Disc Collector's Edition).",5,1

8796069,THE BEST high school movie!,"This is the best high school movie that I have ever seen! I started having all of these memories of when I was in high school as I was watching this  movie. So much of the stuff that happened in this movie has happened to me  throughout my high school years. It is the first realistic high school  comedy that I have ever seen, and I recommend it to anyone. For an R rated  movie, it really wasn't that bad. There were a few &quot;F words&quot; and  some very mild sex talk, but that was it. It could have easily got a PG-13  rating if it had had some trimmings here and there. Anyways, great movie!  Rent it! I know that I will BUY it!",5,1

Mary Roach does visit them and this makes for fascinating reading.  Certainly good enough for me to buy her other works.From nose to anus this is a great read.

2681777,Must-have for every pregnant woman!,"I LOVED this book!  It can be hard sometimes to conceptualize what's going on inside of you when you're pregnant, and this book made everything seem so real.  It was wonderful to have a little update to read on the baby's progress day-to-day.  My husband and I read it together each night before bed- as a father-to-be, it helped him feel involved, and helped him form a bond with our baby.  It also provided us with lots of great opportunity for discussion of the facts, the myths, and the fears of the whole amazing process.  I give this as a gift to every pregnant woman I know!",5,1
5694688,Natalie Cole Everlasting,"Natalie Cole's 1987 Album Everlasting is an important album,because it marked her long awaited Comeback as well as her completed Pop-Rock Crossover.My Favorite to Least Favorite of these songs are Jump Start My Heart,The Urge To Merge, the Remake of Bruce Springsteen's Pink Cadillac,In My Reality,I Live For Your Love,What I Must Do,More Than The Stars,Everlasting,the Solo Remake of her father the late Nat King Cole's When I Fall In Love,Split Decision,and I'm The One.",5,1
2438230,A Great Sequel,"Finding our place and following our hearts is the moving theme of Dare to Dream, a finely-tuned finish to Heidi Thomas's trilogy inspired by the life of her grandmother, an early rodeo-rider. With crisp dialogue and singular scenes we're not only invited into the middle of a western experience of rough stock, riders and generations of ranch tradition, but we're deftly taken into a family drama. This family story takes place beginning in 1941 but it could be happening to families anywhere - and is. Nettie, Jake and Neil struggle to find their place and discover what we all must: life is filled with sorrow and joy: faith, family and friends see us through and give meaning to it all. Nettie,  or as Jake calls her, &#34;Little Gal&#34; will stay in your heart and make you want to re-read the first books just to keep her close. A very satisfying read.&#8212;Jane Kirkpatrick, a New York Times Bestselling author and WILLA Literary Award winner of A Flickering Light",5,1

High reccomendations for this book and I will be passing on the message to my friends.,5,1
2191249,Stephen King - Integrity Personified,"When folks write about personal issues or situations, there lurks a reluctance to reveal truth.  Stephen King shares, with unadulterated honesty, those whom he loves with his reader.  Every man should have a similar mother who encourages him, and a similar wife who loves him with the same lusty, faithful exuberance.  After the stark honesty about his life, Mr. King then exposes secrets (yes, secrets) about being a writer.  He surprises you as he reveals the obvious (only you do not see the obvious until he reveals it) regarding various aspects of writing, particularly fiction, but his revelations fit any genre.  Thus the secrets become simple common sense.  After reading ""On  Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft"", if you are not inspired by Stephen King's life, or if you do not become a better writer, the fault lies within you.",5,1

5573254,"Complex, fast-paced and totally satisfying","K. T. Roberts has a real talent for setting a scene and writing crisp, believable dialogue. I was immediately pulled into the story. Reading Deadly Obsessions, I felt like I was riding along with Detectives Jesse Kensington and Zach Gerard - easvesdropping on their conversations, worrying about their safety as they hunt down a serial killer, and rooting for them to work out the kinks in their personal lives. They were that real to me. The plot is complex and the pace is fast, but the writing is so clear that the reader never looses track of the story.This is a great read as a thriller, but it is much more than that. As the story unfolds, we watch the characters grow and learn to deal with their personal demons. In short, it satisfies both as a crime drama and a love story. I hope to read more Gerard-Kensington Detective stories. These characters are deftly drawn - vulnerable, likable and, most important, completely real.",5,1

I could not put this book down until I finished it.  I enjoyed the narrative point of view from each of the characters.

I look forward to reading more by K.A.Thompson.",4,1
4327510,unlike other books i didnt want my money back,"I really enjoyed this book, there were alot of things going on with the main characters but it wasn't overwhelming  or confusing  like some stories can be.

8626611,Definitively to watch if you love bad movies.,"Leslie Nielsen as the captain of intrepid purebred horny spacemen ? Robbie the Robot ? A long-lost civilization ? This romp to planet Altair, besieged by an unknown evil force, is unbelievably hilarious for its pulp and sixties sensibility. The movie always threatens to morph into a weird episode of some sixties sitcom with a name like ""Leave it to Beaver"" in outer space.

970020,Amazing book... with lots of insight... but one HUGE problem.,"...And the problem is that not everybody is a great storyteller.This book shows how we can use the power of narration in order to sell anything... from ideas, products, concepts... and even ourselves... to ourselves. And also it shows the importance of storytelling in our lives - in the sense that it influences and touches us everywhere we are.But not all of us are born storytellers. And of those who will learn it, not all will look like natural ones.So while this book is brilliant in showing how important our narrative powers are (or can be if we really work them), is also shows the importance of our commitment and our understanding of such value. Important? YES. True? YES. Valuable? YES. Easy? No.I loved the book and it did a lot for me.Recommended.",5,1

1454577,Choking and Intoxicating,"Wildwood Dancing is one of those books that wraps you up in a fog and doesn't let go until you've finished. You choke on the story, that's how thick and rich it is. I loved the descriptions, the love, the setting, the plot, everything. I am not usually that oblivious but I was thrown for a loop when the true Gogu was revealed, don't worry, no spoilers. After I finished this book every other book I picked up was terrible and awful and all I could think was, ""it's not Wildwood Dancing!"" I have since read it several more times and each time I'm once again wrapped up in that lush, imaginative fog where things aren't as they seem and a poor farmgirl can be a princess for a night.The cover art is also amazing. it's what originally drew me to the book. It's fun to look at it and try to figure out what the pictures represent.I would love to hear a story about Tati and her love with Sorrow.",5,1
8736289,A great story,Two kids from New York are arrested in Alabama for a murder that they did not commit.

He has a terrific girl friend who turns out to be a key to winning the case.,5,1
2647695,Just What I Was Looking For,"I've tried a couple programs, only to learn that I am not an auditory learner; this book explains the language so that I can attempt to understand it rather than learning to mouth phrases which I don't really care to know.  Since I'm just starting to explore the book, I can't give a very in-depth review as yet, but it has certainly captured my interest, as well as being a real exercise for my brain.  I have no interest in visiting the country, so I don't need to know how to find a restaurant or bus stop, etc.; but, I would love to be able to understand what is being said in the K-dramas, rather than depending upon sub-titles.  Hopefully, in a couple years, that may happen, with the help of this book.",5,1

3429358,Great inside story,Had a hard time putting this down so read it in two sessions.  It gives such human side of Jacquie from someone who had been with her 24/7.  Puts a different light on things that occurred during the Kennedy administration.  It is so non political it can appeal to persons of any political persuasion.  Highly recommend it.,5,1
676268,Whether Returning to Sugarcreek or just entering it for the first time...,"Shelley Shepard Gray's Hopeful, a definite read to warm your heart. Whether you identify with Miriam, innocently doubtful of herself, full of kindness and a natural insight to others or Mary Kate, fearful and ashamed...your eyes and heart will be touched with  timing and self-awareness only God can bring into one's life. A story of love, healing, courage and faith transpires from the very first word to the very end. Shelley shares with the reader her in depth knowledge of the Amish and their town of Sugarcreek; as if we are truly there. Her talent to write about the Amish, giving Englischers insight and at the same time showing we are all the same as human beings is eloquent. Whether you are Returning to Sugarcreek or just entering it for the first time, Hopeful, is a must read. A delightful, simple book; sparking Hope into each of it's readers.",5,1
6725269,Great Product,Bought this Sony Media Port for my Sony STR-DH810 receiver and a 4th generation Ipod Nano.  It works and sounds great.  You can control the Ipod with the stereo remote control.

8582630,"IT'S NO &quot;ANALYZE THIS&quot;, BUT FUN ROMP THRU A DOOZY SITUATION","Witty theme, darker than you'd expect and with some dead-serious undertones (Burt Young's character, for example, is *scary* without a trace of humor) but this is totally appropriate in context and gives the movie a punch that many comedies lack. Hugh Grant's comic timing took me by surprise, as did Jeanne T's convincing rendition of a mafia don's daughter. James Caan was actually the reason I picked this DVD up and did not regret it. Very worthy spin for an evening if you like atypical comedies in general or mafia comedies in particular.",4,1

This book opens a pathway to a life without diets, guilt about eating and controlling what you eat.The methods and processes are presented embedded in the story. Becoming present is something at least I struggle with and sometimes even abhor because of the emptiness that often follows. It's also one reason I eat after I'm no longer hungry :) Geneens book and everyday meals provide a wonderful framework for becoming present, actually tasting what I eat and dealing with all the emotions/states of mind that follow. I cried and laughed while I read this book.I would recommend Geneen's work to anyone who wants to live their life intensely and authentically, to anyone struggling with weight issues and ready to do anything to change, to anyone ready to face themselves.",5,1

(This is maybe his 5th book that I've read in the donut series.)In this book, it is discovered that the murder victim had 3 girlfriends simultaneously and that 2 of them weren't aware of the others.  The main character, Suzanne, encourages the women to think that this is no big deal, that they shouldn't have assumed that they were in exclusive relationships with the guy.  I disagree with this line of thinking!",1,0

I guessed at which button was the correct one to hit and I must have been right.  Finally, after a day of finagling with it they work great.

Veith has done an outstanding job of teaching the lover of reading what to look for (and look out for) in books.  The author explores how to seek out quality works of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry in helping the reader develop a sense of good literary taste.  The book also explains how literature has changed from the Middle Ages to the present, but in an entertaining way.  Veith's writing style makes sometimes confusing literary concepts easily understood.  A very enjoyable read.",5,1

He covers all the basis with style, spark and creativity.  I found his style to be very modern (but, not too modern. I.E. silver, and black lacquer) hip and full of spaces that everyone would LOVE.  His work is simple but, still very impressive.  I really think that the &quot;average&quot; person could re-create many of the elements that Lowell introduces.  I found myself really drawn to his color choices, design elements, and creative touch.  It's a great book for someone looking to add a lot of spark and polish to a room.  Great resource!",5,1

776940,lovely coming of age story,"I bought this book years ago after reading and falling in love with High Fidelity.  I'm slightly disappointed because About a Boy didn't quite match up to H.F.  I found the beginning a little slow, possibly because I was distracted by not immediately falling in love with the novel.  Through the middle, the story develops a real heart and you begin to fall for the characters of Will and Marcus.  The end is wonderful, not quite the ""happily ever after,"" but this is to be expected.  But you're left with hope for Marcus, and for Will when you finally shut the book and sigh happily that everything worked out alright.",4,1
8104358,Stay prepared. Loved this book,"This was a really good book. I have always cared for the safety of me and my loved ones, this book has put some of that worry away. Let's start, this book has a laser like focus on the most necessary aspects of survival, namely water, heat, medical care and shelter. Every responsible citizen should know these things, and this book explains them wonderfully. I am going to teach everyone in my family some of the things I learned in this book. The part on handling common natural disasters is excellent and full of detailed information. Overall, this book is very well written with plentiful details on all the aspects of survival and preparing for contingencies richly explained.Get this book, your life may depend on it.",5,1
8800511,"Fascinating, tells all you need to know about repression","There were 40 musicals made in the Eastern communist countries. The audiences loved them but the academics, politicians, party leaders and censors barely tolerated them and tried to force them to serve the grim worker mentality of the state.  On the one hand, these musicals are oddly entertaining. On the other, they are a grim reminder of how human happiness and the human spirit is so often strangled by political and religious repressive systems.  People want to laugh, love, and, yes, sing and dance.  Too bad that that is so threatening to so many. This is an interesting documentary that was well worth watching.",4,1

There are several typos in the Kindle version, but I can easily move beyond them without disrupting the flow.  As an avid sports fan, the book is clearly engaging and heartwarming.  It describes the importance of the team concept and overcoming odds.  There is a strange break in the middle of the book where the author goes on a little bit of a rant regarding the downfalls of the NCAA; however, the book has sports, romance, family, camaraderie, and a few surprises along the way making it worth your time.",4,1

It also extends hope and motivation to anybody who is trying to recover from a loss of body function due to brain damage caused by illness or injury. We have so much more potential for self-healing than we realize, if only we go about it in the right way, and persist, against all odds.",5,1

Children in the age bracket 8-12 who were just beginning to learn chess found it very helpful.If you are basically just a beginner, you have played less than 100 games of chess, and/or you feel your tactics are really bad, then I would highly suggest this book to you.

But it was his sophomore release, &#34;The Soul of A Man&#34;, that solidified the arrival of his immense talent for me. With a voice blessed with grace, soul and dignity, Kenny Lattimore somehow has yet to receive his due.Opening with the dazzling first single, &#34;Days Like This&#34;, Kenny delivers a confident, exciting performance wrapped in a swirl of electronic keyboards is easily one of the best singles of the year.",5,1

Fresh out the box, I could get a range of maybe 15 feet before the music started skipping. I then opened the device with a screwdriver (see other reviews on how to do this), removed the metal plate and put the device back together and taped it with black electricians tape. Now the device gives me the 30ft range without any issues.I'm streaming music to the belkin from an ipad 3. The music is 256kbps MP3 files. The belkin itself is connected to a Bose sounddock. So far in over 4 hours of playback I haven't had any issue with the quality of the sound.Given the price of the product, this is an awesome device.

Now a little wiser and wider in my knowledge of literature, I see this book as an earnest, honorable book.  One thing I loved about this book was how the perspective of the book grew  more mature as Francie grew up.  It makes this book a 'happening book', and  draws its readers well into the book while reading.  Another excellent  technique that Smith used in the book is the way she made littel events  seem so important and glorious, the way it would seem to a little girl.

The Sabrent wouldn't get a SATA connection with the Blue so I left the old drive in the laptop and hooked the new HD up instead. The copy process would work for a while, getting slower and slower, and then fail due to an error on the new drive. Came in several mornings hoping for the best and ... nada. Spoke to Sabrent tech support  a couple of times, tried their suggestions, and then returned it at their request.

I can see why Disney kept on trying to get him - his comics were rivaling whatever Disney's artists were doing in comics form (Walt Kelly, Gottfriedson, and the great Carl Barks were probably looking over their shoulders at what Frank was doing all the time). These are great to read to your kids (buy two - one for the parent, the other for the child), and enjoy a more relaxed and entertaining Frazetta; plus all that beautiful artwork!",5,1
1852099,Great premise - Poor execution,"This book sounded perfect for me! I love adventure books filled with history and science (Cussler, Rollins, Crichton) and I teach about Aztec and Maya history. Unfortunately, this book did not even approach my expectations. The author provided paragraphs and pages of description of location, people's backgrounds, appearances, etc. which did not have bearing on the plot, did not drive the story forward, and did not provide insights into motivations of characters. In addition, the many characters began to overlap in my mind and it was difficult to differentiate who was doing what. Sub-plots aboud but do little to create a cohesive story. The ending was a let-down and the ""action"" sequences were more description of events than guiding the reader ""into"" the story. I finished the book because I hate abandoning stories but by the final fourth of the book, I was skimming over narrative to find dialogue and action that had bearing on the plot. I was extremely disappointed.",2,0
1819871,God love the English,I have a penchant for British novels dealing with that English eccentricity that is both hilarious and moving. This book delivers everything I love about English writers. You love the outrageousness and the belief in something more in life than what you've lived and never ending hope and true love that seems buried and cold after 20 or 30 years. How quickly we all forget these things and how wonderfully they are found here. It's not at all predictable or cliche and will surprise you along the way. Just an excellent and satisfying read. I couldn't ask for more.,5,1
4303975,A great conclusion to this series,"I will comment on the whole Surrender to Destiny trilogy as well as this book itself. Each story is unique and yet they flow together so well. The detail that Mrs. Tyndall puts in her books is amazing. The ships, the clothing, the manner of speech, it's all there. The characters are real, not stereotypes, and each of them are unique. Their struggles ring true to us even 200 years later. I can sympathize with the characters and be frustrated by them at the same time because I see myself in them. The message of God having a plan for His people plays out in a very real way throughout the series. In Surrender the Dawn we meet two people from different backgrounds who share a distrust of God and other people. They are different, but a lot alike in that they want to make their own way in the world and provide for their families. Circumstances force them to trust each other and eventually to trust God.",5,1

The caliber of the bullet found in Dutch matched those used by his men, not those who had shot his men down.

9053717,A Noticeable Difference but still Good Batman Entertainment,"There is a noticeable difference between this Volume and the previous 3. This set, as the description says, is from The New Batman Adventures. The animation is different, some of the voices are different (only a few), and the characters are slightly different. For example, in the first three Bruce Wayne and Batman have different voices both voiced by Kevin Conroy while in this volume Batman and Bruce have the same voice voiced by the same voice actor. I also think this set tries to make Batman look more human and less invincible. It focuses more on the story as a whole and Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl rather than how the events affect Bruce/Batman. Altogether, I like this set almost as much as the first three volumes. It is still good Batman entertainment and I'm almost disappointed that I've almost watched all of the episodes in all four volumes.",4,1
9243951,Sad but excellent,"One of my top 10 favorite films. A thought provoking film. Makes you think about what your own priorities are in life and makes you question where are you going in life and what are you doing with your life. As ever, George Clooney &#34;Mr. Eye Candy&#34; is gorgeous and yummy to watch and a special treat we get to see George without his shirt on...yummy!",5,1
8936439,I am thrilled with the new DVD set,"Our friends at Anchor Bay have done it again! They have made the Sleepaway Camp series available to us on DVD...and in a very cool boxed set.

9393801,Bad reviews? Really?,"I cant believe anyone would give this movie a 1 or 2 star, you must not be real horror movie fans. Easily my favorite horror movie of the year, yes I know it had some comedy but its still a horror movie to me. I went in to this movie not knowing much about it other then seeing the horror movie sites I go to weekly say how great it was. Saw it in theaters and bought the dvd day 1, cant wait to rewatch it soon.",5,1
1929923,A Worthwhile Look into the Nordstrom Culture,"The Nordstrom Way was not developed overnight.  It has been four generations and over one hundred years in the making.  It is a culture, not an act that can be turned on and off.  It is a pleasure also to have its recent top salesman Patrick McCarthy share his story.The Nordstrom Way oozes with pride... the pride of providing a top-rate retail experience.  Salesmen are empowered to make decisions.  This is not just lip service.  They carry a card which states ""Rule #1: Use your good judgement in all situations.  There will be no additional rules.""  Emphasis is given to placing the needs of the customer ahead of short-term profits.Other aspects of this 'culture' include promoting only from within and profit-sharing.Most retail outlets have a small Customer Service department.  At Nordstrom, the whole store is the Customer service department.The Nordstrom Way embodies simple concepts that are not necessarily easy for other companies to duplicate.Five Stars",5,1

9352431,Maybe the Dumbest Movie Ever,"Just finished Expendables 2. I think this just may be the dumbest movie I have ever seen.Not only that but it is just horrible. The only good things about the movie are Van Dammeand Scott Adkins. The movie tries way to hard with the inside jokes and trying to giveeverybody their little catch phrases and stupid comments. And really that is all this movieis. The story is horrible, juvenile and pathetic.",1,0
2731186,Grab the tissue,I bought this book for a gal that is having a baby. I read it when it first came out. There was a room of us teachers at a daycare. Not a dry eye after the book was read. Bought one and gave it to my son. It is one I would recommend very highly. Such a special book.,5,1
8697930,Scary and Funny!,"This sequel to Sleepaway Camp is really good! Angela is a very nice camp councelor. But when she finds campers doing ""bad"" things,like doing drugs or playing pranks, she murders them! She lies and says she sent them home but later, people get suspicious. The result is a bloodbath! It's great because it's funny, and the killings are extremely creative! If you liked Sleepaway Camp 1, then your bound to like Sleepaway Camp 2!",4,1
874001,Excellent,"This is the real deal. Mark Twain at his best blasting Big Business and Government through this perfect allegory. Forget the Movie, read the cogent, brilliant story telling which puts you in the picture. You will be transported to the knightly age. Your imagination will be nourished and the humor is on every page. Our ""Hero"", Hank, has the flaws we will all understand. What technology can he add to those ""olden days?""",5,1
8664521,Excellent Hawaii Blu-ray,"I will not compare this blu-ray with BBC nature series. But, it is sufficient to say that both photography and music/narration are excellent. 60-minute video covers quite a bit of materials, and showcases beauty of the three islands. The aerial view footages are great. Just want to mention that this blu-ray has no subtitle, but has scene menu as well as audio setup, in case you are curious. The video is actually widescreen (1.78:1).",5,1
3152949,Not up to par,"I am a huge fan of Maya Angelou and believe I have just about everything she has written on my book shelf.  However, I felt let know and saddened when I read this poem.

I hope the next purchase I make of this amazing woman will fill my heart as her previous writing has done.",1,0

4403258,An unbiased look at the facts,"With so many on both sides bending the numbers and just flat out lying for the sake of their party's interests, it's comforting to have someone who actually knows what they're talking about giving us the situation as it really is. Not all of the findings match up with my personal political philosophy, and I imagine the same can be said for any other registered voter. But all the same, it's a book that should be read by not only every voter, but every presidential candidate, not for the sake of the party, but for the sake of America.",5,1

He's not even my kid, but we hang out waiting for class to be over and one day he wanted to read a book, so POP, I downloaded this book for him and he read it so easily and was so proud. I have since had the luck to download some of her free books (and applaud her allowing kids to read for free, as so many authors do support free lending and free downloads).

1497798,One of Balogh's best,"This book, which is the 6th and last of the Slightly series, is my favorite. It has delightful touches of humor and comes close to slapstick in certain scenes. The hero, Wulfric, is a duke of icy demeanor and rigidly correct behavior. He has no tolerance for fools and distances himself from almost everyone, including his many headstrong siblings. But behind the barricades he has erected lies a man yearning to be loved and understood, wanting to reach out but not knowing how. Enter our heroine, an impoverished widow who, despite a tragedy in her past, has a warm, outgoing nature that makes her a universal favorite. She embraces life, and once Wulfric is drawn in to her orbit - or she is drawn into his - there is no escape for either of them. This hero and heroine are a perfect match and this is a perfect read for a sunny summer day.",5,1

When a man is framed for murder, the question becomes, did he do it for love or did someone frame him using his love interests to make him a prime suspect.As usual, the dialogue is fast paced,  precise and as clear as filtered water.  No words are wasted. No clarification is needed.  The tough guy steps in and does what needs to be done.  Generally this tends to include alcohol, tobacco and more than a few women!!  This is another classic detective novel by the master, Dashiell Hammett!!",5,1

5537389,Fast-Paced Novella!,"Jules waited three-hundred-and-six days to return home in Rachel Morgan's Forgiven. This novella sped right along. Jules is a likeable character with a haunting past she wants to leave in the past, but her secrets are about to come out into the open. Her emotions felt very real to me, and I found myself holding my breath for her. I love Jules's interactions with her sisters. Their relationships were wonderfully complex and endearing. The exotic setting of Durban, South Africa adds an exotic flavor to the read. And the touch of sweet romance budding anew left this tense and emotional read on a high note. I'd highly recommend Rachel Morgan's Forgiven and am looking forward to the rest of the Trouble series.",5,1
3565993,Full of excitement!,"I truly appreciated this book. It is quick moving and captivating.  The author did a splendid work in creating the characters, and the world building. Books I, II & III stream impeccably together and The plots are well thought loaded with anticipation. Each of the stories in the trilogy excitingly expands on each one in turn to add more interest.

It grew uneven and sparse and molded.

After the books arrived and I perused the book jackets I decided to buy additional copies for myself.  I have not read these books yet but I'm sure I will be very happy with them based on other reviews.  I think it's very important to know where we all came from and how this country came to where it is today.  And, while the wrongdoings of the past cannot be undone I believe it's important to understand them and how such things happened, to understand the contributions of Native Americans to  our culture and how they served this nation that did not always serve them.",5,1

I was so glad to get to see more of Rome and Molly's life, and to be honest, seeing things from Rome's POV actually made me re-read Sweet Home.

I love his acting, his character is so on the edge, he puts himself in harms way time after time again.  this show is very suspenseful, reminds me of a cross between Scandal and Criminal Minds, but with better acting.  You never know what you will get with this show...who will die, what type of killer they will deal with, etc. I wish season 3 was free for Prime members, since Amazon has jacked up the annual price.  But that's the only gripe I have, and not the show's fault.  Excellent murder/suspense series!",5,1
1909252,Pointless superficial rumbling,"The book is full of superficial disconnected anecdotes. The authors provide no deep insights, no real explanation of core technological principles, no science front-line update, and no key questions to be answered. Paragraphs are disconnected from one another, with no substantial development of ideas and knowledge. At some point I started skipping 5 pages at a time looking for interesting material. It actually did not disturb the reading, since there is no build-up from one chapter to the next, or even not from one page to the next. The writing style is also poor - here is an example from page 206 (simply where I am now at the book): ""Negative aspects of chemistry include pollution, drug abuse, and the problems posed by semiconductors, computer viruses, identity theft, privacy invasion, cyberwar, and bioterror."" - what's the point of these ""negative aspects of chemistry"" in book about genetic engineering? Bottom line, one of the worst popular science books that I ever read.",1,0

3414068,Implausible,"From the beginning I found it hard to relate to the characters: The protagonist, Amanda James, is this super-woman: more intelligent, better looking and more athletic than anybody you meet in real life. Same for her ex-boyfriend. While I didn't care much for the characters, something about the writing style was intriguing and kept me curious. So I read on. The story of Cain is actually interesting and entertaining to read and history comes alive. But about a quarter way through the book, &uuml;ber-smart Samantha cracks the secret code to the vault door and goes inside without telling anybody else the code. How stupid can you be?! And the next thing is so obvious: The door slams locked and she is trapped. Oh, and she doesn't even panic. I had to stop reading.",2,0
8901183,George just knows how to make zombie films.,"Some people hated this film.  Not sure why.  Perhaps they think George Romero isn't allowed to make zombie movies with a decent budget.  And if he does, it must suck.  Well for my money, Land of the Dead is a good movie.It's well written, well cast and of course expertly directed.  The effects are good.  The zombies look cool and are intelligent(for a change).  And there is of course the familiar Romero social subtext to the plot.  All in all it's a good ride and worth an hour and a half of your time if you like zombie movies.  If you don't like zombie movies, you're probably not reading this review anyways.",4,1

At the end of Chapter 20, the author refers to William Hartington Cavendish, ""the seventh Duke of Devonshire"" as the ""bachelor duke"" who took Joseph Paxton ""as his lifelong friend"".  That is an error.  It was the sixth duke, William George Spencer Cavendish, who was known as the bachelor duke and who made Paxton his gardener at Chatsworth (Hartington is the courtesy title typically given to the Duke's heir).  This seemed to me a very careless error and left me wondering whether the book contains other errors of fact.",4,1

5669164,Excellent,"My personal favorite Billy Joel album.

Seldom one-dimensional, the characters are usually fairly well rounded.Good:The effects of a nearby nuclear explosion seem to have been well researched, and the effects of this over a long period of time seem likely and believable.Poor:The scenario suggested that caused WWIII is extremely unlikely, and threw me out of the story for a few pages.  But this is a very peripheral part of the book, and one bad small note shouldn't destroy your appreciate of an otherwise fine performance.",4,1

8988508,GLORIFIED FAN FILM,"I am a fan of fan films, and very lob budget productions. However, even after watching this and giving the director/producer props for the effort, I found this movie to be pretty horrible (and that is being compared to other FF and LBP). Compared to the director's other films, Demon Summer being one of them, the film sill falls flat.The acting is of course bad, the characters are bad, the story is bad. The blood, well, it's LB and pretty alright for what we are dealing with.However, I did laugh alot with this film. The gay couple was a riot, and at the end when his paperclip chainmail armor saves his life---classic.Only buy this if you can get it used for under 2 bucks, also check out Demon Summer--which was an alright film.",2,0

2239719,Puts you right there with the Corps of Discovery.,"Warning!  Reading this book could make you a lifelong Lewis and Clark fan.  It happened to me. Since reading this book shortly after it was published I have been inspired to more thoroughly study the history of this expedition and even to trace its paths.  Today, as I am writing this, is the 200th anniversary of the expedition's crossing of the continental divide.  For years I had planned to be on Lemhi Pass on this date to commemorate the event.  But, as often occurs, events conspired against me, and instead I am home writing this review.  A few weeks ago, however, I did get the opportunity to travel the Lolo Trail where I visited several Lewis and Clark sites (including the trail itself).  It was a great trip.  Anyway, my life has changed for the better because of this book.  The story is presented in a way that is very readable yet with enough detail to really convey the experiences of these courageous men.",5,1

4499597,Easily the best title on the subject,"Troy Taylor does a fine job exposing his audience to the history and traditions of ghost hunting, despite painting with somewhat broad brushstrokes.  Expectations for any such book should be limited - nothing is going to tell you how to conduct a proper investigation except experience.  Nevertheless, the Guidebook should be plenty enough to give you the courage to get out there and look around, and might also save you the expense of buying a lot of pricey toys you don't really need.  Taylor treats the subject matter seriously, which is refreshing.  I would have really enjoyed a few more ""war stories"" taken from actual experience, but that's what Taylor's other books are for.",4,1

First, the soles are not as cushioned as the other model, probably because the newer sole seems to be of a different, harder material.  Also, because there was not as much &#34;give&#34; in the soles, the high arch -- which I like in the XLTs -- pressed painfully into my heel.  This may also be because the 11 seemed smaller than my current Tevas.",2,0
1133247,3rd Times the Charm,"The first quarter of the book started really slow, but after about getting through the initial beginning, the story picked up.  We find Stephanie our bounty hunter and Lula (bounty hunter in training) looking for Uncle Mo.  We find Ranger still keeping tabs on Stephanie, as Lula thinks Ranger is a superhero, since no one knows where he lives or comes from.  Of course we have Uncle Vinnie, Mom, Dad and Grandma Mazur.  And last but not least, Joe Morelli.  I am really enjoying the chemistry between Stephanie and Joe.  I love their little game of cat and mouse that they play with each other.  Chemistry is what has drawn me to this series.  Stephanie has chemistry with all the main characters in the book and to me it's rare to see that with this many characters.  This book is a great read, I have the next one on my bookshelf and can't wait to dig into it.",4,1

615227,You've got to be kidding,"Obviously mine is not the popular opinion, but I found Excavation to be  terribly disappointing. Granted, I have not read Subterranean, so maybe I  was assuming too much of Rollins as an author. Still, from the Irish  character whose brogue comes and goes (and never actually convincingly), to  the ridiculous conclusion, I have to say that I felt I had wasted my time.  My apologies to his fans...obviously I'm in the minority. As fascinating as  the peripheral images of the book were, and even at times the plot itself,  I felt overall it was pretty disappointing.

THIS Godzilla is a real fun romp that does not hide it's comedy aspects & the agreed upon scientific theory that cockroachs will withstand armageddon & be the only creatures left after mankind destroys the planet. Having Godzilla and Anguilus ""talking"" to each other is funny! I have all but 4 of the Godzilla movies on DVD & I'm going to complete my collection soon (I have all of the VHS movies but I'm switching to DVDs because they will last longer). Many people don't like how Godzilla ""morphs"" from terrible monster to ""nice guy"" humankind helper throughout his movies but I enjoy all of his movies (even the ""bad"" ones) because that's Godzilla's history!",4,1
741864,Great Jump Start,"I've recently had a need to create some cross-platform applications and decided to look at Qt. While the Qt web site provides a great deal of information, I found this text to be a very readable way to quickly come up to speed on creating applications with Qt. Summerfield's prose moves the reader quickly from point to point with a series of short example programs and detailed breakdowns of hows and whys. I also own copies of other Summerfield books, and I've quite enjoyed the rapid learning experience they provide. The Python books (Learning Python / Programming Python / Programming in Python 3) provide more than enough detail for the experienced developer and gently take the novice forward as well. I'm looking forward to the upcoming Advanced Qt Programming book to continue to dive deeper into Qt development.",5,1

4235033,she has a 3 picture deal,"I was already biased towards this book because I like Carol Leifer. M's Leifer writes about her life in comedy with honesty and good humor. She speaks of auditioning for Johnny Carson for 21 times and not getting the gig. While M's Leifer  acknowledges breaking into comedy being more difficult for a woman than a man, she does not dwell upon it. (Although there are some advantages as M's Leifer  points out.). Her experiences with various comedians are entertaining as well as enlightening.But M's Leifer's life story is not just her biography. It is also a guide on how to conduct yourself in the business world. Every experience she relates can  be translated very easily into the working world situations. There is no short cut to success as M's Leifer points out.I recommend this book highly to any fellow Carol Leifer fans and any biography fans. And if you are looking for a guide for work, you couldn't ask for a better mentor than Carol Leifer.",5,1

8771575,WHEN BOND WAS YOUNG,"There was a time when the James Bond movies were directed by real directors and not by the special effects team or a bunch of stuntmen. Yes ! And, at that time, there was a great actor who played James Bond, a no-name  guy who'll become Sean Connery. There was no need, then, of endless  explosions or multiple gunfights to please the audience. DR NO is terrific,  fast and should be showed to all these new directors who believe that they  have to destroy seventy cars while filming a car chase.  In one word, this  movie is refreshing. A DVD for Sean and Ursula fans.",4,1

This book is engaging, funny, sexy, scary, and thrilling all at different times. Very well executed. All the elements were in place; good plot, believable characters, great pace, fun and sexy storyline, good relationship building throughout the book. Also the possibility of the book turning into another, maybe more. The ending left a few  things open for further exploration and I'm really hoping that Susannah does so.

1641220,an enjoyable light read,"This book has the feel of a book written 60 years ago, in a good way. While this story has plenty of tragedy, it does have an innocence, and in many ways romanticizes a hard (and beautiful) life in northern Canada. This book has the feel of a young adult book rather than an adult book. I wish I had known about it when my children were younger - it would have been perfect to read to a 10-13 year old. It is a classic family novel. A nice follow-up to Little House on the Prairie. Much better, actually. As an adult, reading it for myself, it was a book I enjoyed, and it earns 4 stars for me, but it fell short of what I expect of a great novel. I'm glad I read it and I do recommend it to others, especially as an epic family read-aloud.",4,1

I wonder if we could choose our favorites and then have the app &#34;scan&#34; each of them? I know it must be possible, it's in the name, but I haven't figured out how it can be done. Also I worry that the source website counts on it's users to provide content and you know how fragile that can be. I mean people are fallible and at the most critical times they may just forget to turn on their home scanners. Then what do we do?",4,1

It is the most accessible and understandable beginners level book I have seen on the subject.Pascal Dennis' ""Getting the Right Things Done"" also covers the A3 process - though for strategy deployment. Personally I find John Shook's ""Managing to Learn"" more readable and a better introduction to the A3, though they do cover different ground and the one doesn't replace the other.If you want to know more about the A3 planning and problem solving process - that ties everything in lean together - this is a great place to start.",5,1

If you are in need of quality kitchen utensils that should last for years, you may want to look elsewhere.The frames of the strainers are spot welded to the handles.  Those handles are not heavy and can be easily bent.  The mesh of the ""Kuchenprofi Set of 3 Tea Strainers In 18/10 Stainless Steel"" is quite fine and does a nice job of straining small particles out of a liquid.  I also found these useful for sprinkling powdered sugar on cookies without ""snowing"" on surrounding surfaces.  This was the reason I purchased this set and, for this purpose, they work well.For the cost and if you need only one strainer, there are better small strainers available.  If you feel you need a set, then the ""Kuchenprofi Set of 3 Tea Strainers In 18/10 Stainless Steel"" may be acceptable.",4,1

I suggest that we set aside how historically accurate this movie is or is not....all of that is besides the point.I really enjoyed this movie. I've watched most of Bruckheimer's (sp?) movies, but wouldn't consider myself a big fan of his...most of his movies seem a bit flat to me.This movie was different, in that it portrayed relationships and passion and decisions and freedom.I certainly had a few quibbles with it (a Pictish warrior woman would wear THAT into battle?), but again, those fall beside the point.I enjoyed this movie and was impacted by it.

1970997,Wonderful Characters- Not a great ending,"This book was a little difficult to get into at first.  I think it started out a little slow then picked up after a few chapters.  The author does a wonderful job of bringing the characters and settings to life.  However, I found the end to be somewhat of a anti climax.  It was almost as though the author was rushing to put a finish to it and wasn't sure how things should end up.  The story line between Grace and the soldier, although romantic, left me feeling a little confused.  Although it was obvious John was not the right man for her, the way Grace ended up with the soldier left me feeling as though I'd missed a chapter or two somewhere.  Not a bad read but a slightly weak ending.  Still I gave it four stars for pulling me into the story and keeping me there.",4,1

I have backed up the data regularly to two other USB flash drives, one by Corsair and one by Verbatim.  The Corsair and Verbatim flash drives have since both failed after mild use, while the Lexar Echo ZE keeps going.  The only factor keeping it from getting 5 stars is the speed.

And had sacrificed his only son on the altar for the sake of his own pride. Demonic overtones coupled with godless and ridiculous liberalism. No wonder this show flopped. If it was still on tv....I would never tune in again. Stick with all the other Law and Orders. Also try ""Homicide, Life on the street"". It is very very good.

This is definitely Swain's best novel to date, more sophisticated than prior Valentine stories, but not at the expense of the reader.  The scams and deceptions Swain interweaves in this story are his best yet.  Vivid descriptions and character development caused the theatre in my mind to race in overtime, and leaves me wondering when Hollywood or Television will embrace this body of work.  I only hope they don't screw it up.As with Grift Sense, Funny Money, Sucker Bet and my prior favorite Loaded Dice, Mr. Lucky is a fast read (I raced cover to cover in three days).

Stuck with me for months as I waited for the full book to come out (had read the opening scene on the author's website.)  I think with the continued development of the character's aging aspects, even fuller integration of social issues into the plot (already well done), I truly believe we could be looking at the evolvement of a very solid enduring 5 start story.

I bought a 9 and they fit perfectly with a little extra room for bigger socks or inserts if I wanted to add them. I definitely recommend them to everyone!",5,1
2970704,A fun page turner,"I had not read the prequel, but that didn't stop this book from being entertaining and holding my interest. Although I had figured out part of the crime before the denouement, there was an interesting twist that kept me turning the pages to the end. As a fan of mysteries, I have to rate this one pretty high.",5,1
7082129,Boss Audio MC500,I ordered the MC400 system and since they were out of stock they sent the MC500 system instead. This system has a very good remote stereo AM/FM receiver and provides great sound even at upper volume levels.,5,1
7178287,Awesome Little Streamer,"In my opinion this is the best unit on the market. I love to stream videos from Netflix, YouTube etc. This unit does this very well. I also stream my video collection from an external hard drive attached to the USB (it has two) port of this unit and it works flawlessly. I am going to add another of these to replace my old Roku player. I have been using Western Digital products for over 40 years now. They have always been my first choice for hard drives (failure rate very, very low). I have also used Boxee Box and Roku streaming devices, the WD TV Live Media Player is superior to these and supports captioning on everything.",5,1
7052871,Very good case,This is a case I got for an Acer laptop 12&#34;. The case is a little bit bigger than the laptop but protects it very well. The printing and finishing is excellent. My only concern is the seal flap; I would like to have like a small piece of Velcro to improve the sealing. But it is a very good case.,4,1

2238360,Definitely a Challenge,"Uta is a great teacher and actress. Some of her methods, however, don't seem as great. Many of my fellow students had difficulty enjoying her teachings and employing them in their acting, but I find them wonderfully useful. I have definitely grown as an actor after reading this book, and I have watched my characters grow as a result. Uta is sassy, but still manages to teach with love and a passion for her craft. This is a must read for every actor of every level.",4,1
8467282,Easy read,"Plot seems good for movie adaptation.  Moves along quickly,but a little predictable.  This is the second of his books I have read.",4,1

1768697,ANOTHER GOOD ONE BY MARGATET MARON!!!!,"This is the second book in the Deborah Knott Series. In this one Deborah is sworn in as Judge. She is asked to help in building a house for battered women. It is being build by all women workers. Later she finds her niece in the house, beaten up and maybe a rape attempt. The young man who did this is found dead at the scene. Deborah has picked up the hammer used in the killing and therefore could be a suspect. As the story unwinds, her brother is in hopital from arsenic poisoning and the young man who was killed also had arsenic in his blood. The ending is a surprise but very good. I could see the town and the people in my mind as the story progressed. As very good book with what I would call a light mystery. If you want horror and gore, try Patricia Cornwell or John Sandford. I can relate to the family ties that are in the book. Just all around very good.",5,1
9239664,Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths,"It's great! I was a little disappointed in Batman's voice, but it was no biggie. Everything other than that is great and since I'm into parallel universe stuff, it makes it great.",4,1
9265520,Ancient Aliens or Modern Morons? Such a lame cast.,"The so called experts they refer to as ancient alien theorists are out of their minds. How can the History Channel refer to these fools as experts? They are a bunch of science fiction authors who try to pass off their crazy ideas as facts. None of them have any concrete data to back up their nutty notions. The only thing about this series that I have liked is the ancient locations they visit, but every time their ""experts"" open their mouths I have to laugh. Such a lame cast.",1,0
4690719,Bubba and the Dead Woman,This was one of the most entertaining books I have read in quite a while.  Being from a small southern town myself I can totally relate to the gossip machine and all the nosy people.  Poor Bubba and Precious were wonderful.  I would have gladly paid for this one.  Can't wait to read some more by this  Author!!,4,1

6708935,Flickers after 1 day.,"You get what you pay for.I purchased this bulb as a replacement for an OEM bulb that lasted years. The original has some intermittent flickering and has gotten dimmer. I purchased this one hoping to get a deal. No such luck. This bulb, while much brighter than my original has degraded to, flickers after 1 day. Guess I need to spend about 3 times as much to get a real OEM bulb. These appear to be cheap junk. Oh well. It was a gamble anyways. At least I can get a refund.",2,0
1802084,The Panther - Nelson DeMille,"This book is exciting, thrilling and entertaining.  It keeps you going and it seems like the things that are happening in Yemem.All countries have friends and enemies in their countries.Excellent - I have read all or almost all of Nelson DeMille books and have enjoyed and been entertained by all.Great.",5,1
3927987,Absolutely wonderful,I could not tear myself away from this book. Layla and Landen were meant for each  other and over came so many obstacles. I loved reading about their lives and was sad to see the book end. Caisey Quinn did an excellent job on this book and I highly recommend it.,5,1
615771,The beginning to a delightful series!,"Lorraine Heath is an author that, for whatever reason, never gets enough shelf notice at bookstores.  She is in the league of Kleypas, Laurens, and Medieros... and can write circles around Johanna Lindsey when it comes to believable historical romance fiction.With Morgan and Claire's we see an estranged marriage that could go either way... of course we know how it will go, but still throughout the story we are never entirely sure.  There are tears and laughter as only Ms. Heath can do with success.  She is able to write dry wit and tear-jerking scenes with equal aplomb.  Her characters are believable and she knows her Regency history!  I love everyone in this book and am eager to get her other books to see how their stories turn out.I'm really curious as to whether or not she will write a more elaborate story of Tessa and Leo (Morgan's 40-something widowed mother and her 20-something artist lover).  I think that would be a delicious addition to her ""London's Greatest Lovers"" series!",5,1

1746524,Two out of three novels are worth reading in this triology,"Once upon a Blue Moose is a compilation of three short stories by Daniel Pinkwater about Blue Moose.  The first two, Blue Moose and Return of the Moose, are excellent stories - hilarious, informative and engaging! The third story, The Moosepire, is confusing and waste of time.  Overall the book is fun; lot of information is presented in manner which will help kids to enjoy while learning.",4,1
1068753,A Different Point of View,"It's nice to see liberal/progressive writers and pundits starting to fight back against the right-wing propaganda machine.  Conason does a great job of debunking the &quot;lies&quot; of the right and how they've distorted just about everything they write or say about the left.  Conservatives paint themselves as the heroes of the downtrodden, the saviors of the country, and chosen of God.  Well, if their's one thing Conason does is show that load crap for what it is, and unlike the Coulters of the world, he doesn't pull a few bits and scraps from a Lexis-Nexis search then try to create a distortion around it.  It's just the facts, ma'am.  This is a great companion to Franken's Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.",5,1

I'm an engineer so I know how these gadgets work.  I've returned this item and bought a replacement.  Disappointed at the fact that I received a broken product, but very excited to get it a new replacement.",5,1
2810876,Mismatched,"I adored reading this book. Marisol is such a spunky delightful child who doesn't like to match. She likes to wear polka dots and stripes. She eats peanut butter and jelly on her burrito, and she never chooses one things to be when playing games. Marisol does not match and that is perfectly fine with her, even if the other kids don't agree. I think this book is a great way to teach children that it's okay to be different. It's okay to like things that other's might not like and do what others might not want to do. As long as you enjoy it then what others think doesn't matter.",5,1
2071670,A light and fun read,"Although a little unrealistic at times (several times I found myself saying to myself &#34;yeah, right... like that would happen!&#34;), but an enjoyable read with an extra spoonful of western romance thrown in for good measure.",4,1
1402094,Luv to read,I would just like to say that I absolutely LOVED Man of Fate. Rochelle Alers has done it again. From the moment I started reading the story I couldn't put the book down.  It was just a great reading from the beginning to the end.  I actually didn't want to see the story end because I was looking for more. I can't wait to read the next installment to the series.,5,1
2007366,Women,"Horrific account of the women who joined in Hitlers annihilation of the many peoples he didn't like.  What an interesting time and reactions to the way one could go.  Knowing that it was a different time, it seems there should have been more humanity displayed by those who participated.  They must have just put their minds in a different place than the rest of us and carried on, some with gusto and delight until the end when they were caught.  Heartbreaking, really, and now there are some who claim the holocaust didn't occur?  Shame on them.",4,1
604395,Beautifully written,"This book has a very eerie touch about it.  As Liz describes the various places around town, I feel as though I've been there -- because as a matter of fact I have!!!  At her first mention of Rec Park (Recreation Park) where Jonah makes his first appearance, I waited for Liz to describe the carousel that all of us kids walked past on our way to junior high school.  She didn't, but I still saw it.  Last time I was in town the carousel was still going.  To her credit Liz didn't romanticize the town:  her descriptions all rang true and were the perfect backdrop for the story.Beautifully written.  Oh, did I already say that?  Read it.  You'll see what I mean.",5,1
9361716,Just what I was looking for!,"Excellent for beginners!  I've only ever tried one yoga DVD before, and I've never been to an actual class.  I did this one last night and was delighted.  This is exactly what I've been looking for.  It's not hard to follow, and I can see that I'll be able to do this for a long time as I get better at it.  The instructor is outstanding!  Five stars!",5,1

While I really enjoyed her first book, this book had me chuckling.  I, too, have seen those &quot;poached football&quot; feet. Additionally, her editor and proofreader must be commended.  So many books being put out today are like buying a new house and finding out that no one did the final inspection.",5,1

2452030,Let's Join Gaby At The Beach!,This book was really fun to read and it is not necessary to read book one first in order to enjoy Truffles By The Sea.

484741,Truly awesome!,"This book is brilliant, a perfect combination of revisits to old worlds (Gethen, Werel and O) and introductions to completely new ones. ""Unchosen Love"" was just beautiful, as was ""Paradises Lost"", and the tales from Seggri were fascinating, if slightly disturbing. Although ""Old Music..."" (actually Werel in general) didn't do much for me, I've read all the others over and over. Highly recommended - I think this is easily on par with ""The Left Hand of Darkness"" and ""The Dispossessed"".",5,1
7805416,Love it! A must buy!,A friend of mine had a Macy's brand stainless steel tea pot and it turned bronze. It was horrendous looking and since it was in my kitchen I couldn't stand it. I found this one and bought it immediately - even working at Macy's she couldn't find a better tea pot than this for a better price. It's beautiful! And it works great! No flaws. You won't find this anywhere else as good as this one is!,5,1
8098404,loved the series,Loved the series.  the stories kept my interest from the start to finish. And I love happy endings.  Will buy more from this author.,5,1
799482,Good writing,I like being transported to a different place when I read and this series of essays certainly did that. Some places were beautiful and some were not but the writing made the visits worthwhile.,4,1
2782071,Best book on the topic,"If you're interested in learning how to move faster in what ever martial art you do, this is without question the best book on the subject.The things I learned have allowed me to think about how I do things in the two martial arts I train.  Anyone into MMA absolutely MUST read this book.",5,1

1223843,Not for the faint of heart,"One of the main things separating J. K. Rowling from many authors of Literary Fiction is that she doesn't pretend to pull her punches. You pretty much know at the outset what she does and doesn't like, and yet, like any of the best writers of social satire (T. C. Boyle comes to mind) she can show us how much she dislikes someone without demonizing them -- while at the same time avoiding the sanctification of heroes.It's a powerful book, and not for the faint of heart, including frank and thankfully non-prurient depictions of teen sexuality, drug abuse, teen and adult mental illness, and rape.",5,1
1408321,The Cowboy's Courtship (Love Inspired),Alyson Anderson was looking for her Grandmother and did not know she had a twin sister or was even a Forester. Her mother was only interested in Alyson's career as a concert pianist. Jason Bradshaw was determined to go back to bull riding after his injury healed. Working at Camp Hope was helping him more than he knew. Good book.,5,1
785796,A blazing fast and memorable read,"Take something like Charlottes Web and blend it with the Russian Revolution, shake it up a bit and you have Animal Farm.Animal Farm is a satirical look at totalitarianism, complete government control. The animals are sick of the humans controlling them. They are underfed and caged up and just generally mistreated. The animals decide to start a revolution and they successfully drive the humans away. The pigs are known as the intellectuals so they quickly become the leaders of the animals, Napoleon the bore being the one in charge. With the pigs in charge how much will life really improve?Orwell's prose in this book is absolutely flawless. The scenes really jump out of the pages. Right in the beginning Orwell drops quite a large cast of characters for such a quick read but he fleshes them out so perfectly (and succinctly) that you won't become lost.This is a blazing fast read! Orwell doesn't waste a single word. This is a very memorable book. I can't imagine giving it anything less than 5 stars.",5,1
4246892,LOVE it!,"I couldn't keep my hands off this book! I'd put it down and have to pick it back up again. I had to get to the end and find out what all happened.I really can't decide if I like Sam or Jennifer more. Both characters, different in their own ways, were both delightful, wholesome, loving characters. They had personalities that were personable and made you want to get to know them.The morals that came across in this story, like love, trust and acceptance, were told solidly. It will continue to resonate through me for some time.I think lots of people will enjoy this book. Even Stephen King fans. It has a pretty groovy, scary element and suspenseful feel throughout that horror and thriller fans will greatly appreciate.",5,1
6616971,It does the job well.,"I was skeptical, replacing my five year-old plastic mouse pad that came with an Alienware laptop, with a cloth mouse pad. The Alienware mousepad had been worn so smooth in the center, that tracking had started to become erratic, although the edges of the pad still worked, having retained the original texture.Came here to Amazon. Found the reviews for the SteeSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pads. Bought one. Tried it for the last month. Works fabulous. Tracking is fine. The mousepad's rubber backing makes it not slip on my glass top desk.Definitely recommend.",5,1
6028081,One of my all time favorites!,"And i own thousands od CDs and records. The non convention structure of sounds and layout of the songs are incredible. There are elements of heavy metal, classic psychedelic rock, blues and more. This album pulls me into the right atmospheric moods, it carries a vibe I much can relate to. The lyrics are not understandible at times but it works on a very abstract level. I'm surprised this band isn't known more, why? They're better than some of the best known indie bands out there. Guitar pedal fanatics will surely love this band. Get this album!",5,1
1595132,Not so much a biography as a diary of a friendship,"Mostly, ""Kate Remembered"" is Scott Berg's love letter to his mentor and friend. Hepburn shared her life with him through their decades-long friendship, yet made him promise that he would not release this memoir until after she had passed on.His recollections of their times spent together are moving, giving the world a unique look at a special lady we all long to know better and who we miss dearly.",4,1
9377283,Amazing,"100x better than the original anime. I loved how this followed the manga's storyline almost exactly. The brothers also seemed more 'human' in this one and there were a little less ridiculous outbursts from Ed about being short. It was graphically much better as well, but that likely is due to it being Blu-Ray while the original is DVD. The graphics on these discs are nothing short of amazing. I don't think I've seen better animation in any other anime Blu-Ray.",5,1
3088456,Juicing Diet Review,"I highly enjoyed reading this book. &#34;The Juicing Diet&#34; offers a good introduction for those not familiar with the concept of juicing. The author lets the reader know to clean their fruits and vegetables, what types can be utilized, the types of juicers that are used, and listing a variety of recipes to use. Sonoma Press keeps the option of juicing affordable in their suggestions and providing the 150 recipes list. The book mentions this does not have to be primary part of a diet, but this is a good concept to include in a healthy diet overall. I will keep this book in my library for reference. It is very useful to have.",4,1

5001941,Patterson is a wizard at keeping you turning the pages,"I don't normally read a lot of witches or supernatural books but this one kept my attention. I think it's more a teen / tween book, which is probably the target market. I expect the younger crowd will love this one. I did. As expected, Patterson is a wizard at keeping you turning the pages.  I also enjoyedSkull Creek Stakeouta middle grade, scary, funny, mystery andPurple Moona teen angst story about a young girl who has to go live with her rich aunt.",4,1
8582650,A must-see for photographers,"There's a deeper understanding for this movie from photographers, especially pro-level amateurs who keep a day job to support themselves. Almost anyone familiar with the so-called &quot;art scene&quot; will also find many poignant moments. There's a lot of visual and verbal innuendos, so it's great viewing the second and third time around. John Waters fans will love it.",5,1

8049979,Interesting no matter what your persuasion,"This book is interesting because it discusses flirting and its history.  I had no idea that so many people have studied flirting and that so much has been written about flirting.

3576845,Fun vacation read,"Sure, the character development could be better, but this was a pretty good book.  The historical mindset of 17th century Czechoslovakia was very interesting, and the story was gripping.

Sometimes when an author has too much buildup to the actual sex, it can be a big let down. Not the case here. The sex scenes were fantastic, whew...just really good!",5,1
6548450,Works Perfect.,"I bought this to replace a Sony version that I was borrowing from someone.  The Sony always got stuck in the tape deck because the cable ran out the top of the cassette and would get caught.  On the Belkin Xm, the cable comes directly out the back of the cassette so it ejects perfectly and won't wear on the cable over time.It sounds perfect.  I am using it with an iPod touch and often listen to podcasts and music.  There is no background noise, it plays evenly in all speakers and does exactly what it is made to do.  No reason to pay any more than 5.99 to get your electronic device playing through your car stereo.The cord is really long, in fact it's a bit too long for my purposes but I simply used a twisty tie to keep it from getting tangled.  However, it would be nice for anyone who wants to hand control of the mp3 player to the person in the backseat.",5,1

3727148,A temporary friendship,Two people from different cultures find a way to open up and learn from each other. A perfect exchange of skills & knowledge. They grow close but not too close . They both bring their defects to the table too.It could have so easily become a story of forbidden love but stayed on a higher plain. I liked them both and was rooting for them .Loved learning about village life in small town Greece. Can't wait for the next book in this series.,4,1
1286035,Bee-Zarre!,"John Saul spins a &quot;queen&quot; of a tale with this one.  I've read plenty of Saul's novels, this is among the best.It seems all of Saul's works include children, secret medical experiments, and the tearing apart of families becuase of it.  This one is along those lines, but the experimentation is not necessarily intentional.  I'll leave what happens to the reader.  It's WICKED GOOD!Although there isn't as much suspense in The Homing as I'm used to out of Saul, there is more horror that I like to see in his writings.If you are a fan of John Saul, check this one out.  You won't be disappointed.",4,1

Once you read his story you'll look at things differently. We all have something to overcome, it just so happens Auggie wears his hardship on his face. There are so many lines and phrases that stand out I this novel; the writing is second to none. I cried with and for Auggie and his family. I laughed with them. I cheered for them and felt their pain. Thank you R.J. Palacio for giving us this amazing ten year old. Don't miss a chance to read Auggie's story. You'll learn that strength and kindness are contagious.",5,1
952327,Palahniuk is to liturature what Tarentino is to film,"Chuck Palaniuk is a light in a literary word littered with pansy love stories and chick flick screen plays.  Palahniuk's story of anti-hero Victor Mancini is dark, twisted & hysterically funny.  That being said, not everyone will like this book.  Palahniuk is raw and at times obscene.  Choke is incredibly so.  I imagine a lot of people will be offended by some of the language in this book.  If you don't look through the words and into the minds of the characters, all you'll read is obscenities.  For example, some of Victor's sexual exploits are described in graphic detail.  However, I felt as though Palahniuk did an amazing job of removing all sexual excitement from the scenes and making them the emotionless exploits of a helpless addict.  I'd love to go further with this, but it may ruin some of the scenes for those who haven't read it yet.

6786989,Definately the MOST stunning picture I've EVER seen on a TV...,"It likely goes without saying that 240mHz makes a big difference.  However, when I had my HD service installed by Comcast on this TV, even the technician said, ""WOW, that picture is unreal! Is this a 240?  It's like the people are walking around in 3D.""  I couldn't agree more!  It's simply the most amazing television I've ever owned.So, beyond my ""shock and awe"" I've owned a 50"" Panasonic Plasma and a 37"" LCD.  Those two PALE in comparison! Even using a Bluray player on my 50"" plasma (also in 1080p)the picture is EVEN BETTER!  I didn't even realize it was possible!My one caution for this setup, you better like HD reality.  Many shows in HD or movies on Bluray look so real, you literally feel like you're there.  I watched an episode of House last night and thought the clarity and film work was so drastically different that it almost look more like filming of a soap opera.  It's taking some getting used to that's for sure!I can't wait to try the Amazon On-Demand HD movies!!",5,1
7176445,These are great...,"I reviewed my previous set of JVC HAFX5R Gumy headphones and to put it simply I was extremely pleased with those.  Now we have the pro version of the same headphones and I must admit I am over the moon with these.  They fit just as well, if not better, IF...IF that is possible and apparently it is. I got these because I liked the regular Gumy so much as a backup and now they are the backups. The bass response is even more awe inspiring as their predecessor and just as crisp and clean as well. JVC did it right with this series of headphones for sure.  I am convinced that anyone else that tries these will say the same...they are in fact amazing for such small in the ear headphones, since they seem to hold their own even when compared to the much larger over the ear models of headphones. Can't go wrong with these.",5,1

I unplug it every night in hopes to keep its lifespan long.  If you plan to hide this deep back in the corner, that might not be ideal.

1659403,Fascinating yet disappointing tale of Van Gogh's and his lover's fate,"Sad story of characters trapped in the societal norms of their era. Though main characters are well drawn, I found myself tiring of the relentless male domination and self-deceiving arrogance of the father figure. He virtually enslaved his daughter, kept her from Van Gogh, the man she loved, and eventually destroyed the health of the painter he was hired to cure. His daughter out of wedlock was the one element in the book where courage moved beyond traditional scripts. Although I'm an art-lover the fate of the heroine in this novel failed in my estimation as a satisfactory resolution to its narrative build-up.",4,1

5888347,"Gentler, Nastier","Arab Strap's unique appeal has always lain in the juxtaposition of Malcolm Middleton's elegant instrumentation with Aidan Moffat's sinisterly laddish carnal obsessions.  Occasionally their songs have an upbeat and rogueish soul quality, vocals drawled in a heavy Scottish brogue over a curious Glaswegian Motown beat, but it is the slower and more spacious songs on which Arab Strap truly shine.  'The Long Sea' is easily this album's finest, showcasing chiming guitars and meandering keyboards with a Middle Eastern quality that are later overwhelmed by a wall of rich and sumptuous feedback.",4,1

1021231,What I really liked about the book is Wiseman&#8217;s conscientious and respectful approach,"This is a neatly-crafted and thoughtful exploration, in the form of a kind of parent handbook, of the social development of young men. What I really liked about the book is Wiseman&#8217;s conscientious and respectful approach; she thinks of young sons as human beings, and offers practical suggestions for addressing and helping boys to form good behaviors and, ultimately, a solid character. She does this not through coaxing or cajoling, but through real-life examples, all the while explaining the emotional and psychological implications for the boy. In addition to exploring adolescent terminology (which is temporal and maybe not necessary for many readers), sociological contexts and explanations, and warning signs for problems, Wiseman is a pragmatic and empathetic thinker. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with all the conclusions she arrives at, but I admire her tackling of this under-examined arena of human development.",4,1

After buying it, I eagerly began to devour the words of the book, and I just couldn't stop reading. In a few days, I finished this deliciously dark and incredible novel.Compared to the movie that was based on this, this novel was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than the slightly cheesy anime movie. I hated how in the movie, they destroyed how the characters originally looked in the book (D's supposed to be wearing black, not blue; Doris has black hair, not red hair, and her outfit is completely ridiculous in the movie; Larmica is a blonde, not blue-haired; and Rei-Singei is supposed to be exceedingly good-looking, but in the movie, well, he looks really stupid and weird.).This book was worth what I payed for it.

7151822,"Feels good, but does degrade screen quality","I bought this screen protector expecting it to degrade the screen quality to a degree.  I have yet to find a matte finish, anti-glare screen protector that doesn't.  As far as they go, this one is very good.  It was the easiest application I have ever performed.  I also enjoy the matte feeling, but that is a personal preference, of course.  It definitely delivers on cutting the glare.  You lose the glossy beauty of the screen, but it makes it much more functional under bright light conditions.  Also, to get multiple protectors at this price is a great deal considering the same type of protector from bigger names would cost you three times as much (easily) for one protector.  I recommend this product if you're looking to cut the glare and can handle a small amount of degradation.  If not, I would assume that the non-matte version by the same company is just as good and would give that a try.",4,1

8874036,Unknown Life of Rembrandt,Charles Laughton gives the performance of a life time in Alexandr Korda's Rembrandt(1936) as the aging painter whose lfe becomes darker and darker due to personal tragedy.Korda's film starts in Amsterdam at the height of the painter's popularity then his wife dies and he becomes gloomier and more risk taking with his work until he meets and falls in love with a younger servant in his household Hendrickje (Elsa Lanchester). The film details the painter's struggles with the govenment of the city and with his own family.This is a rarely seen Korda film that has some great performances although it was not seen as a success when it was released. Many of the problems related to stresses between Korda and Laughton.

Although this book is not really about Chopin, Poland or his music, the crime story was quite interesting and plot was viable enough for me wanting to finish this book as soon as possible. The only problem (maybe not) I had with this book, it was a bit too short. And because so many writers took on different chapters, one could easily notice different styles and feelings.

When she's on, she's magnificent.  In this book she comes off very close to the latter.  I would say this is one of her better books.",4,1

Faolan running into Tara- the girl he was sure was a shifter too- brought in a luscious male/female interaction to balance the tense, but sensuous time with the men. I loved the romance, sex, and suspense that built as the shifter element became more active in the story. I am sure I went &#34;aww&#34; when the book wrapped up, leaving me wanting to know what happens with these gorgeous shifters and their nontraditional relationship.

4209006,Makes a great graduation gift,"One of the things that I miss most about being a bookseller is being able to recommend books to people with specific requests (not just a general ""what's a good book to read?""). Aligning someone with the perfect book for their needs is very rewarding.What Would Michelle Do? is spot on for people looking for gifts to support young women on to the next phase of their lives as they graduate from high school or college. By using the example of Michelle Obama's life from childhood to adulthood, Samuels guides us through the major decisions that women have to make. Included are topics like self-esteem, enriching your education, making smart financial choices, building a wardrobe, and how to make a relationship work.By all means is this book only for young women. All women will be able to relate to something here.",4,1

This is certainly a colorful treasure of people and places, a well-told story of the fascinating Middle East.",5,1

He and the artists he assembled for this production are nothing short of incredible as they hit every note with grace and craftsmanship.  The production quality approaches that of The Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD, however, I still feel the Eagles hold the honor of producing the benchmark DVD to measure all other concert DVD videos by.  Nevertheless, this concert is a close second and will captivate any JT fan.  ""Shower the People"" actually brought a tear to my eye, sooo sweet! The sound quality of the DTS is exemplary and the DD 5.1 holds its own.  The camera work is right on the mark and the quality of the video is crystal clear.

The book is broken up into each section of town, listing restaurants by type and price with lots of great info about each one, sights not to miss and hotels, hostels and other types of accomodations. Historical background is also included, which I found very helpful.  And, of course, lots of info about the great museums, the ""coffee shops""(don't try to buy coffee in those places!!) and the red light district (you have to see it to believe it - every red-lighted picture window has a woman posing in it!).  The book also includes a pull out map of the city - very helpful.",4,1

The cable is about 3/8"" in thickness.15 feet is plenty long, so I had to coil some and tie it off with wraps. I planned on using this cable for a WD Media Hub, but the wireless adapter is too close to the HDMI port.So I hooked up the DVD player using the HDMI cable instead of a six-cable connector and this is a much cleaner, better way to connect the DVD player.I'm very happy with this cable and definitely recommend it.",5,1

The front edges are a little rough and since that is where I frequently hold the iPad, I keep noticing the roughness. It isn't awful, just annoying. Otherwise, the case is a good solution for protecting your iPad mini in a simple and inexpensive way. The back kickstand is nice. I can recommend this case.UPDATE:  The kickstand broke after about 9 months. I used it frequently and this break meant that I had to purchase a new case. The stand was handled gently and it still broke way too soon. Do not recommend.",1,0

7549845,My Favorite Knife,"I own about 25 different kitchen knives from 6 different knife makers, and the Global GF-33 is far and away my favorite.  I've had this knife now for about a year and it's just a joy to use.  Despite all of my other knives, I find myself constantly picking this one out of the block.  It cuts so effortlessly, it's almost magical.  This is not a light-weight knife, it has heft and size; but it's so well balanced in my (largish) hands that it slices effortlessly through whatever meats or vegetables I throw its way.  Chopping onions is almost a pleasure with it, and I used to hate prepping onions.In the year I've owned it, I've used it probably several times most every day.  At least once a day I run it over Global's ceramic sharpening rod and I've had it professionally sharpened once.  It remains incredibly sharp and friction free when slicing.  Somehow I've recently put two nicks in the front inch of the blade, I hope my local knife sharpener can work these out because I love using every inch of this knife.",5,1

Sound bar standlone has incredible rich sound using opitical input. Subwoofer and satellite speakers sound great when turned on. Calibrating it to my liking took no time at all using the remote. Only negative is satellite speaker wires are to short for where I wanted them but that is not a Vizio issue rather a furniture placement issue. Purchased longer wires and have no complaints.

It's one of those songs when hearing it once is not enough!  The only thing I don't like about Get Away are the shout-outs.  Why?  The proper place for this is on the CD's jacket.

7388506,Good Budget Case,"good budget case for those who don't want to immediately spend $$$ on a metal box to stick their components in. decent non-gaudy look to it with a lot of options for entry level cooling. It won't fit a H100 but it will fit a H60 and will probably fit an H80. Not extraordinarily solid, but it gets the job done. Don't care for the drive cages because they are made of plastic, restrictive in airflow, and the SSD compartment is in a different position, which makes routing power cables a bit of a pain if you want to use the SSD compartment. Also the SSD compartment holds onto drives a little firmly (which in my case is rubbing off the warranty sticker on the SSD, so beware). but it's a great budget case nonetheless which has many premium features like cable routing holes, a PSU dust filter, filtered air intakes and a good front panel hub with USB 3.0 (internal header). would highly recomend for a decent budget build.",4,1

1767865,There's a reason it's considered the best,"There's a reason that Watchmen is considered to be on of the best, if not the best, graphic novel of all time.  That reason is...that it really is just that good.Follow a group of has-been ""masked adventurers"" and one superhero in an alternate version of the Nixon era as they seek to uncover a dark plot behind the murder of one of their own.Moore's story is unmatchable, containing cultural criticism and ethical dilemmas that will challenge the beliefs of the most set minds.  The art is fantastic, the characters are timeless, and you, as the reader, cannot be disappointed.",5,1

9312910,Great show.,It's rare that you find a sci-fi show on television especially these days when the masses are watching cheap reality programming. It is even rarer still to find a sci-fi show that is actually good and worth watching rather than the usual velveeta cheese fare. I really enjoy this show and look forward to watching the second season.,5,1

Clive really is brilliant in this, it's by far the best performance I've seen by Jude, I really believed Portman's love for Law's character and Julia, as usual was completely on point. A really good watch and something I would definitely watch twice.",5,1

8739544,Dark Story,I love to watch Audrey Hepburn movies and thought this would be good.  She did a good acting job but the movie was depressing and the subject of the movie was dark and I feel sorry for any woman who even considers becoming a nun. The movie doesn't leave one warm and fuzzy.  I won't want to watch it again.,1,0
1542902,Afghanistan Like You've Never Read About Before,"About a rich boy who is a wimp that ends up getting a piece of living a poorer life, but then surviving just fine in the US.  Only when he returns to Afghanistan does he start to realize there is unfinished business that he needs to take care of to redeem himself as a more virtuous human being.So many twists that may be predictable for some, but if you're not thinking about the possibilities, may come as a shock.  So well written, that I feel like I was there with the main character, Amir Agha.",5,1

3517634,Entertaining Debut Novel!,"Congratulations to Meaghan Hoffmann on her debut novel! If this, her first novel, is any indication of the novels to come from this talented author, sign me up as a fan! I enjoyed the premise...small town girl meets major Hollywood movie star, sparks fly, love blooms, conflict tears them apart...will they live happily after after? The novel is an enjoyable read, and the characters are engaging. I especially liked the attention to detail incorporated into every scene. Being a writer myself, I find description very hard to write, and am in awe as to how well and seamlessly, Ms. Hoffmann weaves it throughout ever chapter.I would have loved to given this novel the full five star rating, but typos and grammar issues were slightly distracting. Also, I would have liked to have seen a bit more character building on the part of the hero.  That said, and given that this is Meaghan's first novel, and it is, as a whole, pretty darn great, I'll definitely be in line to buy her next book!  Brava!",4,1
853243,"Exciting and dramatic, but a bit too long","I was told that this was a must-read and a can't-put-down. I found it to be exciting but perhaps not up to the hype.The character of Lisbeth is brilliantly drawn and unforgettable, and I look forward to reading Larsson's other books featuring her. I, for one, found the central mystery to be fascinating and the solution both fair and difficult to predict. Where I had a problem was with the Wennerstrom subplot: I expected much more to come of this, and the book's ending, tying up that loose end, was ultimately unsatisfying. Larsson never really connects that subplot with the mystery involving Harriet Vanger. Ultimately, that makes the book too long.Frankly, I was less impressed with Lisbeth's computer hacking skills, which almost seemed like a form of magic that Larsson inserted. than with the creative use of photography to solve the mystery.",4,1

This product meets my needs; it protects a TV, Sat Box, PS3, and a hard drive enclosure.The protector is good quality and has a strong and long cord.

4000192,Fun read,If you enjoy shifter books then this is most definitely an author whose work you need to read. This is the first in what I hope will be the Grayslake series and introduces Sheriff Ty the biggest baddest werebear in charge and he's having a really bad day! There's been a disturbance but when he arrives he finds one of his drunken clan threatening Mia the woman of his dreams and unfortunately she just might be human! She's hiding a werebear cub in her house but is far too stubborn to admit it. Getting her to let him into her home isn't happening so how will he ever convince her to let him into her heart? Ty's day is about to get much worse before it gets better!Fabulous fun to read as Ty struggles to chase down his mate and I loved Mia as she is one tough cookie! I don't like spoilers but this woman even gets his clan on her side and that's no mean feat. Very sensual but nothing that felt gratuitous and this couple deserve a lifetime of happiness.Recommended,5,1
1725532,A book for all ages,"If you see my reviews you'll see that I'm an avid reader. My little daughter bought the Harry Potter's books as they were at sale. She always wanted me to read them and I always told her that I saw the movie and those books aren't for me. I have another avid reader friend and he told me he lost a wager and that he has to read the series. I told him ""lucky you"". He told me to try just one book so I began to read this one...I don't know how will be the other books but I'm sure willing to read them. The book takes you where your imagination wants to go. And that's the way to write a book either for kids or a little older than teenagers.I gladly recommend this book for everybody.",5,1

919659,I almost forget this ISN'T Hammett,"Joe Gores is in love with Dashiel Hammett, and it shows.  His novel ""Hammett"" was a wonderful read, a sort of ""what if?"" story about the master detective-writer as master detective himself.  In ""Spade and Archer,"" Gores tempts hubris by daring to impersonate Hammett himself, writing a prequel to the classic ""The Maltese Falcon.""  Frankly, Gores does such a good job imitating Hammett, that I almost forgot this ISN'T Hammett.  This is an excellent choice for the Dashiel Hammett fan, but more importantly, the book works on its own, and can be enjoyed even by readers unaware of Hammett or ""The Maltese Falcon.""",4,1
2200314,Another Good Traditional SF Novel,"Having read K.D Wentworth's BLACK ON BLACK, I kniew what to expect -- somewhat.  This time she focuses on three alien species, not counting the humans, and brings them all off well.  She has the ability to make the reader care about even minor characters.  The story is pretty traditional SF again, which is not my preferred reading, but Wentworth's book kept me up late at night after I should've gone to sleep &quot;just gotta finish this/the next chapter.&quot;  While not perfect, this is a very good read.",4,1
6105625,"A Great, Quirky Listen","It's tough to place this group and album in a genre - and that's refreshing. Certainly the group relies heavy upon electronic sound, but they're not really electronica. They have a very 70s rock-opera vibe but with a modern approach.Many of the songs are quite catchy, although some (4th Dimensional Trnsition) are quite psychedelic. The music is heavily layered and rich, making an album that's fun to listen to again and again.The duo's vocals and lyrics are quirky, but work well overall.",4,1
3707278,"Very well done, very interesting","The subject was a bit suspect at first,but turned out to be handled very well, very believably.  I enjoyed the descriptions, the tales, the moves from one place to another.  It was a very well written tale, very enjoyable.",5,1

I am sure people who are familiar with some of the books in the author's well-established Fit Expert Series will greatly appreciate this.

2702036,Troubling Yet Not Surprising,"Matt Taibbi. Yeah, the guy is a flaming liberal and not someone with whom I would generally agree, but this book was spot on. Anyone who deals with the market or follows what has gone on in this country for any length of time, knows that the &#34;gap&#34; between the affluent and the poor has expanded at a frightening rate. I would say that I &#34;enjoyed&#34; this book, however that would not be the correct phrase. It angered me, frustrated me and, at times, brought me to tears. No matter what &#34;side&#34; of the political fence you may be on, this is a book well worth reading. Will it change anything in America? I doubt it because I believe it is too late for that. What is eventually going to take place in this country will be not unlike what took place in 1776. This time, however, my 66 years tell me that it will be far worse and much more painful. Put down your remote, put away your golf clubs and do your own homework and see what YOU think.",5,1
939217,Disappointed,"I thought I would love this book.  I eagerly awaited its arrival from my book club.  I was so disappointed.  The premise seemed so promising but instead, I found the book predictable and unbelievable at times.  The strangest feeling I had was that I didn't like ANY of the characters and that's a first for me.  I didn't care if any of them were in danger.  None of them were likable -- especially the heroine and her hunky boyfriend.  I had to force myself to finish the book hoping the whole time that it would get better.  This is coming from someone who adores a good novel full of mystery and intrigue.",1,0

3035269,Revenge all wrapped up in Crazy!,"This book grabbed me immediately and drug me headfirst into the story line. I felt like I was a great friend to the characters and observing their story from afar. On several occasions I found myself yelling at the book - ""NO! Don't do that!"" or ""Kiss her, already, you silly fool!"" The characters are believable, interesting and yet mysterious. It is a captivating love story all tucked up neatly inside a suspenseful thriller.Mary writes a solid book, edited with great care. Her character development is stunning.My favorite line in the book is: ""The crazy bitch wasn't going to smear her reputation just to get revenge on her ex-boyfriend."" OOOH.. Revenge all wrapped up in crazy. I loved it!",5,1
2214957,You'll Find Yourself in Here,"This book is unabashadly honest.  Mothers who are hard on themselves (find me one who isn't!) will find themselves in these pages in refreshingly forgiving and honest ways.  Some of these essays have laugh out loud moments, and about every one is well written and poignant.  Every topic that might concern a mom is represented here:  abandonment, anger, boredom, illness, single parent issues, sibling rivalry, and so on. I received this book as a gift and took a while to get around to reading it (almost three years).  I wish I had picked it up sooner; it would have brought me so much delight and comfort even sooner.",5,1

Without the rubber pieces, the clamp does not seem to be able to hold on to anything. Maybe it was supposed to be glued and wasn't? Also, no matter how hard to tighten the ballhead, the flash will tend to creep downwards (potentially putting enough stress on the clip to cause problem #1).

2002504,Necessary Read,"Not always an easy read, but a necessary read.  No matter what the left states, the facts reveal the truth.  President Kennedy was deeply religious and anti communist.  Yes, he has foibles, but it is clear that he loved the United States,  and unlike our current President, he viewed America as exceptional compared to other countries.  This book with all of its quotes from Kennedy contradicts the liberal belief that Kennedy was one of theirs.  If you doubt, just read this.  The facts based on his speeches cannot be disputed.",4,1

4520532,A compelling and beautiful novel,"Leora Skolkin-Smith has given us the gift of a beautifully crafted novel set in a time and place of change and turmoil. Every scene pulled me further into the story and held me captive. The author is as much poet as novelist, with each lilting phrase somehow revealing an entire story. Tight writing, nothing wasted, the purest form of literature. I was sure that I knew where the story was headed...and I was wrong. Every page will surprise.",5,1

6160672,Classic Rory with a red-hot live bonus CD!!,"This is one of Rory's best albums! Great songs! Rory is widely heralded as being underrated (an ironic phrase--lol) for his guitar playing, but I consider his songwriting abilities equal to his guitar playing! Great songs with enough hooks to make them catchy, but not ""sell-out"" tunes written strictly for Top 40 radio by any means (Rory was always against writing for the radio rather than writing straight from the heart)! Some songs are better than others, of course, but overall a solid outing. The live CD? Awesome!! Rory is just on fire, with a great blend of fingering and slide playing! His BEST playing that I've heard live--I'm serious!! If you're a Rory fan (or are interested in getting into his music), do NOT hesitate to buy this 2 CD set!! A great deal!!!",5,1
8971139,I Have Waited So Long,"Due to the negative reviews, I have waited too long to buy this DVD. I had it in my wish list for ages.  Fortunately, I recently had the opportunity to watch this DVD on a videostore and I realized that my fears were unfounded.This DVD reviews have mentioned too many complains about the video or production quality, and although I don't disagree with some of these comments, its flaws aren't that great so as to detract from the real pleasure of owning this DVD... watching Foreigner at arguably, their peak.The concert video and sound are very good, more so considering this is not a recent tour.  This concert is based on the The Very Best ... and Beyond Tour, and I watched them in Caracas, Venezuela during this tour.  It was an amazing concert.  This DVD captures its spirit and showcases the great setlist Foreigner played during the tour.I do not regret at all buying this DVD, this is Lou and Mick at their very best, great songs, great energy.

2013137,Inspiring,"I had been looking for books on meditation, and bought ""Mindfulness in Plain English"", which is also great, by the way. However, I was told that ""Peace is Every Step"" could be more inspiring, because it wasn't intended to be a kind of manual (the kind that simply says ""do this, do that""). Well, it is true. ""Peace is Every Step"" does not teach meditation the way I wanted, and for that ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" was perfect. But ""Peace is Every Step"" was what I needed to get meditation to be part of my whole life, and not only half an hour of my day. In other words, ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" taught me how to do it. ""Peace is Every Step"" taught me what to do with it, and taught me meditaton is much more. It made meditation become part of my daily life. Now I understand why I was told it is inpiring.",5,1

HOWEVER... the face that holds the phone does not seem to have anything other than gravity holding it on.  I've pushed as hard as I can and it doesn't click in to place or anything.  without building a jig to be able to hammer the thing, I couldn't push any harder without breaking it.  It stays in place, but I'll probably tack it on with a touch of silicone glue so as not to worry about it.When I first got it, it didn't want to charge the phone unless I tilted the phone slightly forward.  I pushed on the usb connector with my thumbs HARD and it works fine now.",4,1

7234404,Zero Bubble,"very nice clear screen protector...without the screen protector, the screen on the Asus Transformer Prime attracted so much finger prints.  The screen protector helps reduced the finger prints issues w/o quality trade-off.I installed the screen protector in the bathroom with the vent on and hot shower running to reduce the dust particles in the air. I also pre-clean the screen with a anti static cloth.  I used the cold air from a hair drier to make sure the glass surface is dust free prior to attaching the plastic screen protector.  I use gloves during the installation process to prevent accidentally leaving finger prints.Got the screen installed w/o any bubble on the first try.  Now I got 2 extra screen protectors.Amazon shipped this to me very promptly.  :-)",5,1

The authors leave enough space to write in the book.  And at this price, you will want to write all over it.  I have had less luck with workbooks that ask for a paragraph, but make you enter it in your own notebook.Also there is a good glossary at the end of the book so you can easily look up unknown words without having to lug your dictionary around.I can't say enough good.

Although the others have had substance and charm, this reads as if it were written for and by a fifteen year old.  The characters were underdeveloped and there was little or no plot, just a very predictable and sugary sweet ending. I missed the characters who came together to knit and share their heartaches and dreams at ""A Good Yarn"". Sadly, this book, although pleasant enough, just does not belong on Blossom Street.  What a big disappointment!  I just can't understand all the five star reviews!!",2,0
3207910,Public school teachers every where could write this!,"Immediately, I could tell that this teacher/author was telling the real story of many public schools in the U.S.  This book should be read by the public--parents, grandparents, advocates for education.  Most teachers cannot tell parents how badly they are being treated by the administrators.  Or how their children are not receiving the services they should receive.  Children are over-tested.  Teachers have no choice but to teach to the test.  In some places, the teaching is even scripted for the teacher.  How could any student sit through that.  We need parents, grandparents, etc. to start figuring out what is happening in our public schools.  Read this book!",5,1

I remember the old series from my youth and I thought them at the time some of the coolest and scariest comics around.  Unfortunately as I reread the stories they are not always first class.  The artwork is below standard and the stories very elementary.  Having said that, I did love going back to these old stories and Dark Horse cannot be faulted in any way.

1048932,Here are the critical ingredients that your novel may be missing,"When I first noticed this book on Amazon, I thought, ""Who does this guy think he's impressing with this title?"" But I finally decided to read the sample anyway, and was instantly hooked. I was in the middle writing my ninth novel, my first thriller, and was having doubts. Would it be a book that people would love enough to tell their friends about it? Would the story continue to haunt them for days, months, years? Would they remember my characters as though they were real people?That's what I wanted for my book, and James N. Frey helped me get it.My writing has improved as I wrote each of my novels, but this book (and all four of James N. Frey's other writing books, which I quickly bought and read after loving this one) helped me skip forward into my writing future--instantly gaining the knowledge of having written several more books by simply reading and applying his advice.I highly recommend this book!",5,1

The only thing I didn't like was there are no instructions regarding what all the keys do, and I had to visit various websites just to find out the basics.  Also, I kinda played around with some of them and figured them out, but a tiny manual or chart showing the keys and what they did would be nice.

She was bratty and annoying and she spoiled the story for me.As for the story, it was nice enough, but I kept feeling there was more that could be done with it.

9103153,This film could have been so much better...,"**Spoilers**I really wanted to like this movie but I found myself giggling at the 'love' story between Eisenheim (Norton) and Sophie (Biel). Edward Norton and Jessica Biel have no chemistry whatsoever due to Jessica's lack of talent, which in turn, makes Edward look hammy and over-doing it.And really, was no one expecting the end? Did anyone really believe Jessica's character was really dead? I also don't think writers really allowed the childhood friendship-crush pan out so the rest of the movie is rather forced and predictable. I have great respect for Edward Norton and would watch anything he's in but sometimes, even his accent was questionable. The romance is painfully, and sadly comical but the technical point in which the film was shot is beautiful. If not for Biel's ability to ruin every movie she's in, and if the plot was panned out more evenly, I think this film would have been better. But for the most, I was disappointed.",2,0
4172764,Book does what it promises,"This is a very simple review to write.  The book does what it promises.  Left hand page is the text of the play, to the right what each character says is given the literary equivalent of subtitles in colloquial english.For example, a character says about men in a shipwreck: ""Not a hair perished.  On their sustaining garments not a blemish, but fresher than before.""Confused? Look to the translation on the opposing page: ""Nobody was hurt in the slightest.  Even their clothes were unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.""Works better than a mere glossary because it puts the meaning of the characters' statements into 21st century English.  And Shakespeare is much more enjoyable and comprehensible when you know what is going on.",5,1

727649,"A quick, pleasing diversion","Curious Incident is a nice book, a quick and frothy read that I thoroughly enjoyed. My mind boggles a bit at the adulation heaped upon it, a sort of uncritical fervor last seen hyping the much less worthy Da Vinci Code.Breezily written, this book borrows some writing tricks from more substantial work. Notably, of course, is the use of a first person narrator who is ""impaired"" (in this case by autism) in a manner similar to, say, Flowers for Algernon. The use of unusual chapter numbering (prime numbers in this case), statistics problems, diagrams, and so forth is amusing in a observational kind of way. These are all tricks, though, that make you sit back a bit from the book. Oooh! Isn't that clever?In any case, the back half of the book seemed to telegraph much of the plot and I surely hope we don't get a sequel. But it is so amusing and a nice diversion from much of the drivel available today that I recommend this novel as a good, enjoyable read.",4,1

Derek Murphy is an editor, cover designer, author and internet entrepreneur with a well-rounded appreciation of the publishing game. His advice comes from years of marketing experience, and trial-and-error in his own business, and was just the sort of information I was craving.He filled in the blanks left by other marketing books, instead giving me a new appreciation for the importance of my website and social platform &#8211; things I had neglected in the past, as well as ideas on how best to apply paid marketing. Now, instead of a murky, confused marketing plan, I have a to-do list I can&#8217;t wait to get started on.",5,1
585815,Charming!,"Another delightfully witty gem from Julia Quinn! This is a story of a boy and a girl growing up and coming to the realization that their friendship has turned into romantic love. It's charming and lighthearted (but not without conflict). The excellent dialogue and Quinn's pleasing writing will have you trying to bend the ear of any reader friends who happen to be nearby: ""Oh! Just listen to this for a minute!"" This isn't a hot and steamy romance; it's more a tale of the sweetness and giddiness of first love expertly told. If you're looking for titillating sex scenes, you should probably skip this one. Here, Quinn offers us a chance to share the magic as Honoria and Marcus discover that they have well & truly fallen--and what do they do now? I thoroughly enjoyed reading this, and several months later I enjoyed rereading it. (A lovely bonus for Quinn fans--Honoria's story gives us part of the infamous Smythe-Smiths' story: it's the first book of the Smythe-Smith quartet.)",5,1

These songs are written from the heart and soul and exhibit much energy and really soothe the soul.Doug Gray is one of the true great singers in all of contemporary recorded music. Not to lnock Toy Caldwells vocals on Can't You See or Hillbilly Band.  There is plenty of passion from him. Their voices just blend in nicely with the fine instrumentation of the other band members, background vocalists, and guest artists like Charlie Daniels, Paul Hornsby, and Jaimoe.  Keyboards, saxaphones, fiddles, guitars,etc.. this record has it all.Loud and soft but basically free and easy all of these tracks are winners.  Take The Highway, Hillbilly Band, Can't You See, and My Jesus Told Me So stand out the most.

But IR is a line of sight system and doesn't work for every situation.  The Pocket Wizard is a great solution to that problem.  because it is a radio transmitter, I can put my flashes anywhere I want including around corners.  I have been using them for a few months now and they have always performed the way I want them to.  The only draw backs that I can think of, is that they are constructed out of plastic, so they feel a little cheap.  But I have dropped one before on the pavement and it survived so I think they can take some abuse.  Also you need to set your flashes to manual mode which takes a little longer to balance the lighting just right for portraits.  if you are shooting Canon (I shoot Nikon), Pocket Wizard has a set that can support TTL mode.  I am waiting for the Nikon version to come out.  but when IR doesn't do the job, there is nothing better than the Pocket Wizards!",5,1

5483985,"A clever, unique and smartly written thriller","When I saw the name  ""Einstein"" my curiosity was piqued.  The author successfully managed to take one of my favorite topics- history and then mix it nicely in with sci-fiction (time travel).That was great but then the author goes a step further and adds in mystery.  This created an unquestionable home run of a read.The characters were all very solidly created and the plot was well thought out.The story was a different one -  Jacob had a hunch that Einstein had made a deathbed confession.This hunch leads to a search and the book unfolds to tell a great story.The attention to detail and unique plot made Einstein's Secret a fun and fast read with a unique and fresh take on time travel.The way time travel was used felt so authentic that it turned the book into a realistic thriller with a fast paced energy that wouldn't let up.I will be recommending this one to several of my friends.  I think this is one that may be headed to the best seller list.Excellent read!",5,1
5762622,Their Strongest Overall,"I love the band, but when I listen to them I have to admit I make my own compilation out their CD's because their albums just aren't strong all the way through.  In my opinion this is their strongest album overall. It's the only one I STILL enjoy listening to all the way through after years of owning it.  This is the album I would recommend if someone way buying their first Cake album.",4,1
4109922,So-So,"If you are well-versed in this subject and complementing a library of research on this subject, this book is OK.  There are a few pieces of wisdom in it.  However, if you are inexperienced, or if you can only afford one book, do not get this one. Some of the advice was actually dangerous.  For example, many of the techniques suggested to""diffuse through empathy"" will actually backfire in a very significant way.  They can act as triggers particularly if the individual has a sensitivity about one of those issues the author suggested you be ""empathetic"" about ...Reading this made me wonder if the author has hands-on experience or if this is all theoretical case study?",1,0
8860149,REALISTIC VIEW OF DOOMSDAY,"I was so taken aback by the graphic realities of this movie, that I even purchased a very bad pirated copy off e-bay. The only compliant I have about this movie, is that it had yet to be released as a region 1 DVD. I still have the VHS tape as well. This is by far the most graphic, realistic portrail of the long term consequences of global nuclear war. There are no winners in muclear war. Everyone loses in such a war, even if it is limited. This movie should be a MUST for all the world's leaders to watch as they play chicken with their ""red buttons"" and ""footballs"". Perhaps even someone as simple minded as W can understand the consequences of these horrible weapons, and why the world should be uniting in their elimination. If you thought Testament or the Day After was graphic, that is a trip through a fantsyland compared to the realities pictured in Threads.",5,1
6936083,ATA to SATA splitter,"Good to have around, especially if you fix PC's, or if you have a semi old case and have both power connectors and might be out of the new SATA's... this will use one of the old connectors and allow you to connect 2 more hard drives.",5,1
2892694,Live by design!,"Finally a book that teaches us all why and how to live in language.  Every thing, everything, we do, have and are (our being) happens through and in language.  If the concepts in this book were to be taught in elementary school and continued throughout life, the world would be a better place.",5,1
1122218,As good as it gets.,"I've long been a fan of the Clare Fergusson/Rus Van Alstyne mysteries and this one does not disappoint.The story grabs one early on and it is a real page-turner right through to the end.There are some pertinent lessons in communication skills (which are sadly lacking in the two main characters and which put them in peril) that should be instructive for readers in similar relationships.That is, it is always better to put things out in the open as soon as possible so there will be no chance for a potential life-threatening event because one is to proud or too embarrassed to admit something to a partner.If one loves edge-of-the-seat crises, coming one after another, this will certainly satisfy.",5,1
